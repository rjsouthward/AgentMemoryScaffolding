    "\n",
    "> **Reference:** See **Section 4.4 (Synthesis & Report Composition)** in the handout for comprehensive methodology on evidence synthesis and investigative narrative construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "Synthesize your research findings into a comprehensive investigative report using automated DSPy-based processing pipelines that demonstrate advanced research capabilities beyond traditional literature synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generated Report Structure:\n",
    "1. **Executive Summary:** A concise overview of your key findings and their significance\n",
    "2. **Sections:** Use `#` for primary sections; Use `##` for subsections that organize detailed analysis; etc.\n",
    "3. **Inline Citations:** Use numbered references in square brackets (e.g., `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`)\n",
    "4. **Bibliography:** Conclude with a reference section where each line follows the format: `[index]. URL or source description`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Thesis-Specific Literature Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your three generated theses from Action Item 6, conduct targeted literature searches for each thesis. Implement a `LiteratureSearchAgentRequest` with the `guideline` parameter to focus searches on supporting evidence for each specific thesis. Set `with_synthesis=False` to collect raw `rag_responses` for later processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Key Insight Identification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a `KeyInsightIdentifier` DSPy signature to automatically extract the most important insight from each RAG response. This reduces noise and focuses on essential information for report composition. The key insight should be a concise, one-sentence summary capturing the most relevant information for each question-answer pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Report Structure and Guideline Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `FinalWritingGuidelineProposal` DSPy signature that uses the collected key insights to:\n",
    "- Generate a unified report thesis that synthesizes your investigative findings\n",
    "- Propose a structured writing guideline in bullet-point format outlining key sections and content organization\n",
    "- Ensure logical flow from background through specific discoveries to implications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Automated Report Synthesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a `FinalReportSynthesizer` DSPy signature that combines the report thesis, writing guidelines, and all collected evidence into a coherent investigative report. The synthesizer should:\n",
    "- Merge relevant information into logically coherent narrative sections\n",
    "- Preserve all original citations exactly as provided\n",
    "- Eliminate redundancy while maintaining completeness\n",
    "- Create smooth transitions between thematic sections\n",
    "- Constrain content to provided information without external speculation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality Standards:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final report should demonstrate investigative depth by presenting original analytical insights not readily available in existing literature, comprehensive coverage through automated integration of evidence from multiple search iterations, logical organization with clear progression from initial questions to final conclusions, and proper attribution through systematic citation preservation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The completed report should read as a coherent investigative piece rather than a collection of separate research summaries, showcasing the power of automated synthesis in building compelling investigative narratives from distributed evidence sources.\n",

      "writing guideline: 1. **Executive Summary:**  \n",
      "   - Begin with a concise synthesis of the key findings that supports the argumentative thesis: the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a watershed moment marking a shift in warfare from mass casualty events to persistent, technologically-enabled disruption and attritional strategies.  \n",
      "   - Clearly state that drone warfare, as seen in 2022–2024, exemplifies this transition and shapes both local and regional security doctrines.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Evidence-based Narrative:**  \n",
      "   - Structure the report to tangibly link both main theses:  \n",
      "     a) The vast proliferation and sophistication of drone and drone-assisted warfare, emphasizing quantitative escalations (millions of UAVs, daily attack rates), innovation (AI integration, decentralized production, long-range UAV operations), and operational outcomes (cross-border strikes, cost efficiency, disruption of high-value military and industrial assets)[^1][^2][^3].  \n",
      "     b) The persistence of high-precision, low-unit-cost attacks with low per-event fatalities, correlating with strategies prioritizing infrastructure disruption and economic/social destabilization over traditional high-fatality warfare[^4][^5][^6].\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Insight Integration:**  \n",
      "   - Interweave key insights and statistics throughout the text with inline citations, emphasizing the investigative approach (e.g., contrast Ukraine’s decentralized, innovative adaptations with Russia’s centralized, mass-production escalation).  \n",
      "   - Highlight documented changes in enemy capacity, casualty rates, and measured impacts on economic output, public services, and social morale.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Hybrid Warfare and Legal Context:**  \n",
      "   - Analyze how these drone campaigns exemplify 'hybrid warfare,' citing real-world case studies (e.g., attacks on energy grids, oil refineries, agricultural blockades) and their economic/social ripple effects both domestically and internationally.  \n",
      "   - Summarize expert consensus and military doctrine that signal a strategic pivot towards persistent disruption, economic attrition, and blending of kinetic with non-kinetic, low-intensity operations.\n",
      "   - Address contemporary legal frameworks and protection doctrines, identifying documented enforcement or accountability gaps amid the evolving nature of conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Regional and Doctrinal Impacts:**  \n",
      "   - Explain how this shift is influencing regional military doctrines and procurement, especially within NATO and neighboring states, through greater integration of counter-drone and rapid-response capacities, “layered defenses,” and drone-centric tactics.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Structure:**  \n",
      "   - Use clear sections with **bolded section headers** for each theme (e.g., **Scale and Innovation of Drone Warfare**, **Persistent Disruption Over Mass Casualties**, **Economic and Social Attrition**, **Legal and Doctrinal Gaps**).  \n",
      "   - Incorporate **boxed citations** or footnotes for every factual claim, ensuring transparency and verifiability.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Conclusion:**  \n",
      "   - Synthesize implications for future warfare: the replacement of high-casualty conflict with persistent, cost-effective, technologically-enabled disruption, providing a blueprint for hybrid warfare and exposing new vulnerabilities in governance and international law.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Bibliography:**  \n",

Russia is ramping up nightly drone attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure, and as it rapidly increases its production of those weapons its strikes are intensifying. \\nMany of the drones aren’t particularly fast or high-tech, but they are cheap enough for the Kremlin to launch more than 700 in one night, in an effort to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses and decimate civilian morale, experts say. \\nAfter obtaining Iranian designs for Shahed attack drones, Russia [built its own massive factory](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/europe/russia-drone-factory-iran-intl) to churn out thousands of these weapons each month. Its evolving tactics are forcing Ukraine to fight back with more expensive ammunition and innovations, as less costly methods of defense become less effective. \\nThe rapid increase in drone strikes shows how warfare has evolved to rely on these unmanned autonomous vehicles. \\nUkraine and Russia have been driven to improve drone capabilities to compensate for deficiencies in air force capabilities, a dynamic that isn’t applicable to all Western powers. But experts say that the United States and its European NATO allies are actively working to improve drones and counter-drone operations to retain an advantage in any future conflicts. \\n“NATO will probably end up using drones on a large scale. Not at the same scale as Russia and Ukraine, because we’ve got these massive air forces that we’ve invested in and that can strike with a lot of power very quickly – but as a complement to that,” Robert Tollast, a research fellow focused on land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told CNN.', 'Taiwan is already looking into developing large numbers of cheap attack drones, Tollast said. Non-state actors across the globe and drug cartels are also increasingly relying on drones. “These are going to pose a huge challenge to unprepared armies around the world,” he added. \\nThis is how Russia’s drone campaign operates – and how Ukraine is working to fight back. \\nRussia is moving toward producing more than 6,000 Shahed-type drones each month, Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence told CNN. And it’s much cheaper to produce the attack drones inside Russia compared to earlier in the war, when Moscow was purchasing them from Tehran. \\n“In 2022, Russia paid an average of $200,000 for one such drone,” a Ukrainian Defense Intelligence source said. “In 2025, that number came down to approximately $70,000,” due to the large-scale production at the Alabuga drone factory in Russia’s Tatarstan region. \\nBut cost estimates vary greatly – the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a DC-based think tank, found that estimates for Shahed-136s ranged from $20,000 to $50,000 per drone. By comparison, a single surface-to-air missile interceptor can cost more than $3 million. \\nThat relatively low cost makes it possible for the Kremlin to ramp up its nightly drone attacks, as well as conduct more frequent large-scale attacks. Earlier in the war, major missile-and-drone salvos happened roughly once a month. By mid-2025, they occured every eight days on average, according to by CSIS. \\nTo many civilians, the constant threat of drone attacks is terrifying. \\nAn apartment building is heavily damaged following a Russian drone strike in Odesa, Ukraine, on July 24, 2025.\\nKyiv resident Bohdana Zhupanyna was heavily pregnant when her family’s apartment was obliterated by a Russian drone strike in July.'], title=\"How Russia's drone attacks have reshaped the war in Ukraine - CNN\", timestamp=None, reason_for_retrieval='statistics on drone warfare usage by Russia and Ukraine 2022-2024', document_type=<DocumentType.DOCUMENT_TYPE_WEB_PAGE: 1>, metadata=None), RetrievedDocument(url='https://understandingwar.org/research/russia-ukraine/russian-drone-innovations-are-likely-achieving-effects-of-battlefield-air-interdiction-in-ukraine/', excerpts=['[32] https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/shahed-fpv-killzone/33476992.html; https://www.thetimes.com/world/russia-ukraine-war/article/fpv-drones-strike-anthony-loyd-sqgw92l2v; https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-force-generation-and-technological-adaptations-update-july-25-2025#:~:text=A%20Ukrainian%20military%20expert%20reported,operators%20to%20operate%20these%20drones.; https://t.me/rybar/70097; https://www.radiosvoboda dot org/a/shahed-fpv-killzone/33476992.html\\n[33] https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-force-generation-and-technological-adaptations-update-july-25-2025; https://armyinform dot com.ua/2025/05/31/na-potoczi-letyat-fpv-mizh-nymy-stvolna-arta-ukrayinski-paladiny-polyuyut-na-tanky-ta-sklady-rf-pid-harkovom/; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4XONrDJWsc&ab_channel=%D0%A1%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BF%D1%96%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%9D%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8 ; https://suspilne dot media/donbas/999141-zsu-na-limanskomu-napramku-sposterigaut-rezim-tisi-60-ombr/ ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Szeuva9Fl4s ; https://armyinform.com dot ua/2025/04/02/vyklykayut-na-sebe-vogon-na-lymanskomu-napryamku-pershymy-v-myasorubku-kydayut-vyazniv/; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5TqaWCCdUg; https://armyinform dot com.ua/2025/05/27/yizhu-zakrepam-mozhut-ne-davaty-poblyzu-lymanu-rosijski-komandyry-kydayut-v-ataky-nenavchenyh-pihotyncziv/\\n[39] https://understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Russian%20Force%20Generation%20and%20Adaptations%20Update%20July%2025%2C%202025%20PDF.pdf; https://united24media dot com/latest-news/russia-hit-kharkiv-with-a-new-drone-called-chernika-heres-what-we-know-about-it-9500; https://gwaramedia dot com/en/russian-forces-use-new-drone-chernika-for-the-first-time-to-attack-kharkiv/'], title='Russian Drone Innovations are Likely Achieving Effects of Battlefield ...', timestamp=None, reason_for_retrieval='statistics on drone warfare usage by Russia and Ukraine 2022-2024', document_type=<DocumentType.DOCUMENT_TYPE_WEB_PAGE: 1>, metadata=None), RetrievedDocument(url='https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-launches-6400-drones-missiles-ukraine-record-breaking/story?id=124201916', excerpts=['# Russia launches 6,400 drones, missiles into Ukraine in record-breaking month\\nThe scale of Russia\\'s nightly strikes has been steadily increasing.\\nAugust 1, 2025, 1:07 AM\\nMore than three years into Russia\\'s full-scale invasion, Ukrainians across the country retreat each night to bomb shelters and metro stations in a nightly ritual necessitated by the long reach of Moscow\\'s drones and missiles.

The Ukrainian military’s innovative and rapidly evolving use of unmanned aerial vehicles to create a layered defense is often referred to as a “.” If this Ukrainian drone wall can prove itself over the coming months and blunt Putin’s big offensive, this will likely shape future defensive doctrine in military academies across Europe and beyond.\\nThe military use of unmanned aerial vehicles has evolved dramatically since the onset of Russia’s invasion more than three years ago, leading many to call the current conflict the world’s first ever full-scale drone war. As the invasion enters a fourth summer, drones are currently thought to account for of all Russian and Ukrainian battlefield casualties.\\nUkraine’s drone wall tactics emerged out of military necessity and are part of this far broader shift toward the dominance of unmanned systems on the modern battlefield. Following Russia’s victory in the Battle of Avdiivka in early 2024, Ukraine found itself on the defensive and facing of artillery amid delays in anticipated US aid. Kyiv responded by turning to drones as a cheap and effective substitute for more conventional munitions.\\nWhile drones lack the firepower to completely replace artillery, Ukraine’s deployment of drones to create defensive corridors many miles deep has proved remarkably effective. Drones are used both for surveillance purposes and to conduct airstrikes, making it extremely difficult for enemy forces to concentrate and launch large-scale offensive operations. The impact of this approach can be seen in the sheer scale of the damage being done to Putin’s invading army. Britain’s _International Institute for Strategic Studies_ has that Russian losses in 2024 included around 1400 tanks along with more than 3700 armored vehicles.', '#### As the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\\nAs Ukraine’s drone wall has taken shape over the past eighteen months, Russian commanders have been forced to adapt their own tactics. Instead of depending on large armored columns to punch through Ukrainian defenses, Russia has becoming increasingly reliant on small infantry units working to achieve local advances. Rather than traveling in armored vehicles, soldiers now often use highly mobile forms of transport such as and buggies in order to evade drones.\\nRussia is mirroring Ukraine’s progress in the field of drone warfare as the two nations compete in a daily race to innovate and gain a battlefield advantage. At present, the Russians have managed to achieve a significant edge through the large-scale manufacture and deployment of drones operated via fiber optic cables. This has been hailed by some as a game changer as such models cannot be jammed using existing electronic warfare tools.\\nMeanwhile, Russia is increasingly targeting Ukrainian drone operators and the radar stations they depend on.

These aircraft have been central to Russia’s campaign of missile attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, often launching from well beyond Ukraine’s defensive reach. The A-50 early warning aircraft, also struck in this operation, are integral to Russia’s airborne command-and-control structure, helping to coordinate fighter jet movements and detect Ukrainian air defenses.\\nWhat made this operation truly remarkable was the means of delivery. Ukraine used 117 FPV drones—typically associated with short-range tactical engagements—and repurposed them for strategic effect. These drones were not launched from Ukrainian soil but from within Russian territory itself. Months of clandestine preparation allowed the SBU and military collaborators to smuggle drones and launch equipment across the border. The payloads were hidden inside civilian-looking vehicles such as cargo trucks and mobile wooden homes that were strategically stationed near the bases.\\nEach truck was equipped with a remote-control system, including retractable roofs that allowed the drones to be launched silently and discreetly. Once the drones were airborne, operators used visual feeds and likely GPS assistance to guide them to their targets. The drones attacked nearly simultaneously across vast distances, causing widespread confusion and overwhelming any coordinated Russian defense.\\nNotably, Ukrainian operatives who had set up the launch zones were exfiltrated before the strike commenced, a detail that underscores the operation’s intelligence sophistication and high-level coordination. The ability to not only stage and launch such an operation but to do so while extracting the personnel involved demonstrates a level of operational maturity that few nations possess.', 'Visual-based AI systems, integrated with GPS navigation, allowed these drones to operate effectively even in electronic warfare environments. Russia has invested heavily in GPS-jamming and signal disruption technologies. Yet, by launching from within Russian territory and using AI-based target recognition, Ukrainian drones were able to evade these defenses. Real-time image processing and adaptive flight correction systems enhanced their strike accuracy, even in adverse conditions.\\nMoreover, the logistical component of the operation revealed another layer of technological sophistication. The drones were concealed in specially modified civilian trucks, disguised as mobile homes or commercial cargo. These vehicles were equipped with retractable launch platforms and onboard communication systems, allowing remote activation. This hybrid model of warfare—blending stealth logistics, AI, and mobile strike capability—represents a departure from traditional military doctrines centered on large, centralized platforms.\\nThe drones (not to scale) were launched from kit homes loaded onto trucks\\nImportantly, the low cost of FPV drones compared to the high-value targets they destroyed points to a major shift in the economics of warfare. With units costing as little as a few thousand dollars, Ukraine was able to inflict billions in damages. This cost-effectiveness makes drone swarms an attractive option for other nations and non-state actors alike, potentially triggering a global shift in procurement priorities and military doctrine.\\nUkraine’s growing domestic capacity to produce and adapt these drones—supported by Western funding and open-source innovation—suggests that the country is on the frontier of military technology.

First, their speed is typically only 150–400 km/h, many times slower than ballistic missiles and two to three times slower than cruise missiles. Second, their warheads are relatively small because more space must be reserved for fuel to cover vast distances. Most long-range drones also lack stealth features and are vulnerable to electronic warfare and air defense systems.

Much of the existing scholarship focuses on the impact of a few types of drones, despite growth in new types. Such scholarship also makes assumptions that drones can be shot down with ease. This approach limits our understanding of their strategic value. Marcel Plichta analyses Ukraine’s use of one-way attack drones to target Russian military and industrial facilities between June 2022 and January 2025. The study finds that Ukraine’s one-way attack drones imposed severe costs on Russia, despite their vulnerability to air defence. The findings call for further research into the utility of drones and drone countermeasures in interstate wars.◼\\nFew military developments in the Russo-Ukrainian war receive as much public and academic attention as drones. However, comparatively little scholarly attention has been given to the long-range one-way attack (OWA) drones that Russia and Ukraine use to strike deep in each other’s territory. This article discusses Ukraine’s use of OWA drones to strike targets in Russia. It begins by outlining the state of strategic studies scholarship on drones, and provides an assessment of Ukraine’s OWA drone campaign from mid-2022 to early 2025. The number of successful strikes shows that relatively inexpensive standoff platforms can challenge states’ air defence assets and have a strategic impact on the defender.', 'Ukraine’s use of long-range OWA drones against Russia is worthy of scholarly attention for two reasons. First, this conflict features an enormous number of OWA drones. Long-range OWA drones are used in conflicts in Yemen, Israel and Iraq, but their use is an order of magnitude higher in Ukraine and Russia. In September 2024, the Ukrainian government claimed that Russia had launched over 8,000 OWA drones at the country since the start of the conflict. Ukrainian OWA drone use is likely lower but still dwarfs drone use by actors such as the Houthis in similar timeframes.\\nSecond, Ukraine’s development of an OWA drone fleet has implications for proliferating precise mass. Ukraine has concurrent drone and missile programmes, but, to date, Kyiv has been able to manufacture many more OWA drones than missiles. The effectiveness of its drone campaign is consequential for minor powers and non-state actors, who may be able to produce or acquire OWA drones more easily than traditional missiles. Ukraine and Russia are arms exporters in peacetime and could well end up selling their OWA drones abroad if buyers see a strategic benefit to acquiring a modest standoff capability.\\nOf course, the lower cost of most OWA drones compared with other standoff systems comes with trade-offs. OWA drones tend to have smaller warheads and fly slower than a cruise or ballistic missile. Strategic studies scholars are correct that current drones are vulnerable to air defence systems. Many OWA drones also use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) – such as GPS or GLONASS – to reach their targets, which make them vulnerable to electronic warfare (EW) systems that jam or spoof GNSS. This has led to a cycle of innovation and counter-innovation whereby users of drones and drone countermeasures adapt to each other’s new techniques and methods, pushing up the costs of drones.', 'After spending 2022 and 2023 developing the capability to launch a sustained OWA drone campaign, Ukraine has dramatically escalated operations since 2024. In early 2024, Ukraine launched a large series of strikes on Russian oil infrastructure. By April, the US government claimed that the strikes temporarily halted approximately 14% of Russia’s refining capacity, caused a halt in exports and caused fuel price spikes in Russia. The crisis led the US government to publicly disavow Ukrainian drone attacks and reportedly privately pressure Kyiv to cease attacks. While Ukraine never fully halted attacks on oil infrastructure, it returned to striking a wider variety of targets until January 2025. These included industrial targets such as chemical plants and military facilities in previously untouched regions such as Chechnya. In May 2024, Ukrainian drones attacked a Russian long-range radar installation, demonstrating the range of expensive targets within Russia that are under threat.\\nUkraine improved its OWA drone campaign by scaling up drone production with external assistance as well as technological advancements. Ukrainian drones likely use GNSS as an inexpensive way to navigate hundreds of kilometres autonomously, but using it risks interception by Russian EW. In August 2024, several news outlets reported that Ukraine was using terrain mapping, whereby the OWA drone uses machine learning to understand its position from the geography surrounding it. Leveraging machine learning is more complex than using pre-existing satellite navigation, but it is substantially harder for Russia to use EW to locate or defeat OWA drones using it, and demonstrates that modular improvements can challenge air defence assumptions.'], title=\"Precise Mass in Action: Assessing Ukraine's One-Way Attack Drone ...\", timestamp=None, reason_for_retrieval='documented outcomes of Ukraine long-range UAVs in cost-effective precision warfare', document_type=<DocumentType.DOCUMENT_TYPE_WEB_PAGE: 1>, metadata=None), RetrievedDocument(url='https://understandingwar.org/research/russia-ukraine/russian-drone-innovations-are-likely-achieving-effects-of-battlefield-air-interdiction-in-ukraine/', excerpts=['Further drone adaptations may render traditional EW and air defense countermeasures ineffective on the battlefield. Ukrainian EW systems are becoming less effective against new EW-resistant or medium range drones, although EW systems are unlikely to become completely obsolete due to the likelihood that radio-controlled FPV drones will remain in large numbers on the battlefield because of their simplicity and low cost. Beskresnov observed that the effectiveness of Ukrainian EW systems mounted on trucks is decreasing because Russian FPV drones are operating on a wider range of frequencies, which makes it challenging for Ukrainian forces to defeat them.[70] Beskrestnov reported that Ukrainian forces do not have enough stationary EW systems to protect all rear areas to a depth of 30 to 40 kilometers and need additional systems to protect against EW-resistant fiber optic UAVs.[71] Traditional air defense countermeasures may be insufficient to resist tactical UAVs en masse, as they are scarce and expensive to operate and scale. Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces (USF) reported that traditional air defense missiles can cost up to one million dollars, for example.[72] Ukrainian mobile fire groups may also have a more challenging time shooting down tactical drones that are flying beyond the frontlines, at higher altitudes, or hibernating until activation.', 'Ukraine can prevent Russian forces from achieving the limited effects of BAI by urgently developing tactical kinetic anti-drone systems. Ukrainian developers urgently need to develop a variety of new and inexpensive kinetic countermeasures, both for long-range Shahed and tactical UAVs on the battlefield and in the near rear. Ukrainian developers have fielded some tactical UAV interceptors, such as Shrike FPV interceptors that cost $300 to $500 and can target Russian reconnaissance and strike UAVs.[73] Ukrainian forces notably posted footage in April 2025 reportedly showing Shrike interceptors targeting Russian Supercam and Merlin reconnaissance drones.[74] Ukrainian developers recently tested robotic air defense modules, which can be fitted with machine guns and are designed to engage low-flying and slow-moving aerial targets.[75] Ukrainian forces are also reportedly planning to start using prototypes of reusable interceptor drones that fire projectiles at Russian UAVs to lower costs and offset shortages of drone interceptor production.[76]\\nUkraine will also need to continue to develop EW systems and countermeasures to suppress radio-controlled FPV UAVs that are still present in large numbers on the frontlines. Beskretnov observed that radio-controlled UAVs still dominate “in percentage terms,” and Russia will likely continue to use these drones in combination with more advanced FPV UAVs and loitering munitions out of cost efficiency.[77] Ukraine will need to develop new EW capabilities that are able to suppress UAVs at greater distances.', 'Military Learning and Future of WarfareRussian Force Generation and Technological Adaptations Update\\n# Russian Drone Innovations are Likely Achieving Effects of Battlefield Air Interdiction in Ukraine\\n# Russian Drone Innovations are Likely Achieving Effects of Battlefield Air Interdiction in Ukraine\\nThe Russian integration of combined unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attack tactics and adaptations is giving Russian forces important advantages on the battlefield in Ukraine and facilitating Russian advances on key Ukrainian towns.

Unmanned aerial systems (UAS), drones, have gone from emerging technology to crucial assets on the battlefield (Jakes, L., Santora, M., Kramer, A. E., Hernandez, M. and Sholudko, L., 2025). Their sudden ascent altered the pace, cost, and conduct of warfare, offering valuable lessons on the future of military operations (Bronk, J., 2025). To ensure credible deterrence against future threats, NATO must fully understand the impact of modern drone warfare and adjust its strategic posture accordingly (Jakes, L., 2025). Yet, experts caution that, while drones will represent a key asset, they are unlikely to replace traditional military power (Bronk, J., 2025).\\n#### The Ascendancy of Drones in Ukraine\\nSince 2022, the drone industry has grown rapidly, becoming essential to Ukraine’s defence strategy (Halstian, M., 2025). Initially reliant on foreign drones and merely seven domestic manufacturers, Ukraine quickly indigenised production, building over two million FPV drones in 2024, and in February 2025, President Zelensky stated that Ukraine is now capable of producing 4 million drones annually (Finer, J. and Shimer, D., 2025).\\nDrones have proven highly effective on the battlefield, with commanders attributing 70 to 80% of all Russian and Ukrainian casualties to their use (Jakes, L., Santora, M., Kramer, A. E., Hernandez, M. and Sholudko, L., 2025). Moreover, Ukraine managed to increase its success rate from 30% in 2022 to 70% in 2024 by compensating for reduced accuracy with a larger number of drones (Tian, N., Scarazzato, L. and Guiberteau Ricard, J., 2025).', 'Ukraine’s experience shows how drones shaped the current battlefield while still depending on integration with conventional firepower. For NATO, this highlights the need to increase drone production while still maintaining strong conventional capabilities and a balanced force posture. Current disparities in defence spending, counter-electronic warfare capabilities and procurement timelines could lead the Alliance to fall behind adversaries. Therefore, NATO’s deterrence will depend on its ability to maintain strategic readiness, technological advantage and operational resilience as well as strong conventional capabilities.\\n  1.

What the conflict has so far highlighted is that the frequently mentioned “game-changing effect” of drones on warfare depends on the game. Based on their category, drones produce distinctive military effects either as an extension of air power or as ammunition. Military thinking is therefore changing, making armed drones more politically acceptable. There is also reduced focus on the large armed and surveillance drones known from counterterrorism operations, as better integrated small drone scouts now serve land forces in combat. Far from being a mere security nuisance, small drones have yet to be effectively countered with air defenses. Military and dual-use export controls require adaptation to keep pace with these evolving battlefield realities. The drone lessons of the war in Ukraine thus point to many future challenges lying in wait for the international community.\\nOn the final night of 2022, Ukrainian quadcopters buzzed over the frontline town of Bakhmut and dropped bomblets on Russian soldiers across the battlefield. With thermal imaging cameras that enabled them to identify targets in pitch black conditions, these small drones flew unspotted. Meanwhile, halfway across the country in the Kyiv Oblast, dozens of Russian loitering munitions struck Ukrainian energy facilities and apartment complexes, killing up to four and psychologically terrorizing the civilian population.', 'Russia’s war on Ukraine has also provided a testing ground for foreign drone powers, such as Turkey, the United States, and Iran, further accelerating drone proliferation. The war has meanwhile served as a public relations campaign for armed drones and loitering munitions, changing the public image of drones along the way. Drone operations in Ukraine contrast with the use of large drone systems in the war on terror over the past two decades, which became controversial due to their association with collateral damage and targeted killings beyond official battlefields.\\nChanged perceptions of drone utility—especially of small armed drones and drone scouts—are likely to affect countries’ future acquisitions. Indeed, the value of drone diversity in accomplishing military missions appears to be among the critical emerging technology lessons of this war. Adopting a comprehensive approach to drones that includes cost-efficient anti-drone defenses and uncrewed platforms across various domains will be an enduring lesson for militaries, policymakers, and industry.\\nNATO classifies drones into three widely accepted main types based on their maximum take-off weight (NATO ): class I drones of less than 150 kilograms (kg) or about 331 pounds (lb), including small, mini, and micro drones; class II tactical drones of between 150 and 600 kg (331 and 1,323 lbs); and class III drones of greater than 600 kg. The drone dynamics in Ukraine have largely showcased class I and III systems. While large drones with missiles can be destructive under conditions of air superiority, small drones are proving crucial for battlespace awareness of infantry and maneuvering units. In addition, low-cost, one-way “kamikaze” attack drones offer yet another way to deliver explosives.\\nFrom drones that fit in a backpack to model airplanes and those carrying lighter payloads (maximum 150 kg, but more commonly less than 10 kg), smaller drones have established their usefulness in Ukraine’s contested airspace.'], title='The war in Ukraine shows the game-changing effect of drones ...', timestamp=None, reason_for_retrieval='analyses impact of drone warfare on Russia-Ukraine conflict regional security doctrines Eastern Europe', document_type=<DocumentType.DOCUMENT_TYPE_WEB_PAGE: 1>, metadata=None), RetrievedDocument(url='https://www.csis.org/analysis/russia-ukraine-drone-war-innovation-frontlines-and-beyond', excerpts=['We have to discuss the impact of electronic warfare and counter-UAS technologies because, as I’ve indicated, each development in this war gives an impetus and a necessary push for counter development.

But electronic warfare doesn’t work successfully by itself. It has to work in a system.

This prevented us from reporting on more granular data such as anatomic region of injury or outcomes other than injury/death. Second, our study only accounted for casualties resulting directly from attacks, and individuals affected by secondary effects may not be captured in our data. Third, the complete communications blackout during the conflict made data collection and quality monitoring difficult. Consequently, there is potential for underreporting of drone attacks. Finally, our study encompassed a limited geographic range and time period due to its focus on airstrike-related casualties as well as constraints on data collection inherent to conflict.

However, the global proliferation of precision strike technologies, like missiles and armed drones, makes such weapons progressively available to non-state armed groups (NSAGs). We look at Daesh in Syria and Iraq and at the Houthis in Yemen as two case studies to analyse the consequences of this proliferation for non-state warfare. Our focus is the socio-spatial dimension of warfare. We probe to what extent precision strike technology is used to conquer and control territory (solid warfare) or to weaken the enemy network without territorial ambition (liquid warfare). The predominant view in the literature on NSAGs perceives them as would-be state builders who desire to govern and hence, seek to control territory. Our findings support this view, as both Daesh and the Houthis have applied precision strike technologies for solid warfare. However, at the same time, both groups have used these weapons for liquid warfare, too, targeting in particular civilians and civilian infrastructure to weaken the network of their enemies. This poses new questions to scholars of small wars and insurgencies and calls upon policy makers to increase efforts to curb the proliferation of precision strike technologies.', 'As military technology proliferates, non-state armed groups (NSAGs) like Hezbollah, Hamas and others can procure the means by which they can attack their opponents from a safe distance, too. This is well documented. However, research on the consequences of this on the socio-spatial dimension of NSAGs’ warfare is lacking. We seek to close this gap and ask: What is the impact of precision strike technology on the socio-spatial dimension of non-state armed groups’ warfare? To answer this question, we build on the distinction between ‘solid’ and ‘liquid warfare’, according to which solid warfare’s goal is military conquest and control of territory, while liquid warfare seeks to destroy enemy networks and avoid territorial confinement. Based on the literature on NSAGs, we should expect that these groups make use of precision strike technology to support the conquest and control of territory; i.e. that they apply it for solid warfare. Research on NSAGs has convincingly argued that most of these groups, even though they differ in many aspects, are would-be state-builders that must gain control over territory in order to govern. And even those NSAGs that are rather ‘commercial insurgencies’ depend on the control of at least some territory.', 'This finding is highly relevant for scholars of small wars and insurgencies, because it draws attention to a new strategic option for NSAGs that comes along with the proliferation of precision strike technologies, posing a series of new questions that broaden the research agenda on NSAGs, e.g. with regard to conflict escalation, NSAGs military success, and the consequences for civilians. While answering all these questions is beyond the scope of this article, we sketch out this research agenda in the conclusion and provide some hints regarding conflict escalation and the consequences for civilians. In particular the latter should be of interest to the policy community, too. As the proliferation of precision strike technology turns civilians not only into reachable but also ‘logical’ targets (in a liquid warfare strategy), this proliferation and in particular strategies to curb it should receive more attention by policy makers.\\nIn the next section, we introduce the typology of solid/liquid warfare and relate it to NSAGs warfare. Then we discuss the two cases, first the Houthis and then Daesh, to analyse the impact of remote warfare technology on the socio-spatial dimension of their warfare.

Joseph Nye’s served the post–Cold War order. However, today’s gray-zone environment, marked by fragmented sovereignty, systemic fragility, and contested legitimacy, demands a more adaptive and operationally attuned framework. This paper introduces Adaptive Power, a next-generation doctrine of influence built on five interdependent pillars: Timing, Context, Legitimacy, Modularity, and Learning. Unlike Smart Power’s static balance of tools, Adaptive Power emphasizes agility, strategic rhythm, and the contextual fit of influence across domains and timeframes.\\nIt incorporates emerging security principles such as systemic fragility, resilience, enabling influence, and consultative planning, grounded in years of Indo-Pacific field observation and strategic wargaming. The doctrine responds directly to adversaries’ use of Sharp Power—covert, coercive, and manipulative influence—by offering a coherent, legitimacy-driven alternative. Tailored to U.S. and allied competition in the gray zone, Adaptive Power aligns with Department of Defense priorities to campaign in competition, strengthen partner resilience, and evolve deterrence strategy in a fractured security landscape.', 'For much of the modern era, U.S. military power and strategic leadership have played a central role in sustaining global security and deterring large-scale conflict. Today, that role is being tested in new ways, and some go so far as to say that the U.S. is in decline (Adams, 2024). The Indo-Pacific region has become the principal arena for strategic competition, where revisionist powers seek to challenge longstanding norms through coercive influence, incremental encroachments, and hybrid operations short of war. States face fragmented sovereignty, cross-domain threats, contested legitimacy, and a fractured information environment.\\nIn this evolving environment, the effectiveness of U.S. deterrence and influence is shaped less by the scale of its assets and more by how those assets are employed—when, where, and with what degree of legitimacy and responsiveness. Adversaries are operating across legal, informational, economic, and security domains to exploit systemic gaps, shape perceptions, and shift balances of power without triggering direct confrontation. This has revealed critical vulnerabilities in static models of power projection and signaled the need for an updated strategic framework.', 'Adaptive Power Principle(s): Timing, Legitimacy\\nDoD Priority: Integrated Deterrence, Campaigning in Competition\\nOperational Implication: U.S. forces and interagency actors must maintain a forward presence that is locally resonant and continuously consultative. This means investing in sustained, low-friction activities, such as port visits, legal capacity building, data sharing, and border-security interfaces, that create influence ecosystems before crises happen.

Drones have become an ever-present threat near critical US infrastructure, including nuclear facilities, electrical grids, and even the White House, prompting new legislation and counter-UAS authorities and tools for the Department of Homeland Security and other domestic security agencies. July 2020 marked the first publicized drone attack attempt on a US facility, when a DJI Mavic 2 drone narrowly failed in an attack that appeared to be aimed at short-circuiting a Pennsylvania electrical substation. This is likely to be the first of many future attempts, as US critical infrastructure remains an attractive, vulnerable, and almost inevitable target. \\nAs drones evolve the capability to autonomously navigate, carry larger payloads, and operate across domains, they become ideal tools for malicious actors. Deep-diving unmanned underwater vehicles are becoming more sophisticated and more readily available, making undersea cables and offshore infrastructure increasingly attractive targets. Hamas is known to possess drone submarines that it uses to target Israel’s offshore gas platforms, and Houthi rebels are confirmed to have added unmanned underwater vehicles to their arsenal. The effects of critical infrastructure attacks are potentially devastating and may include power blackouts, supply chain disruptions, and telecommunication system interruptions. \\n> Beyond the apparent and immediate physical damage, the psychological impact of a drone attack cannot be overstated.', 'Adversaries employ hybrid tactics to target strategic resources, obliquely or overtly. Despite prohibitions under international law, strategic denial of access to essential goods, including food, water, and energy, is becoming distressingly commonplace and generates global consequences. Russia’s deliberate destruction of Ukraine’s agricultural production capacity and blockade of Ukrainian wheat exports created a global food crisis that has particularly affected South Asian and African nations far away from the battlefield. The United States destroyed ISIS-controlled oil fields in Syria and Iraq in 2015 and 2016, while both Russia and Ukraine have targeted each other’s energy resources since Russia’s invasion began.', 'Non-state actors certainly recognize the shock effect of strategic resource disruption and have successfully carried out drone-enabled attacks to produce it. In September 2019, for example, the Aramco Abqaiq oil facilities in Saudi Arabia were hit by a combined swarm attack consisting of 18 drones and seven cruise missiles. Houthi insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack, although given the level of sophistication and precision, most Western analysts at the time assumed some level of Iranian government involvement. Regardless of the source, the attack achieved devastating outcomes by temporarily shutting down five percent of the world’s oil supply, which led to as much as a 20 percent increase in global oil prices. This swarm attack was especially disturbing because it defeated a robust, state-of-the-art air defense system that had been installed by the United States and Saudi Arabia; the system included Patriot missile batteries, and was intended to protect the facility and surrounding oil fields. Combined swarms of drones and missiles appear to be emerging as a favored mode of attack for Iran and so-called Iran-affiliated “resistance forces,” as further evidenced by the massive swarm attack aimed at Israel on 13 April 2024 and regular Houthi-initiated volleys targeting maritime traffic in the Red Sea.\\n> This swarm attack was especially disturbing because it defeated a robust, state-of-the-art air defense system that had been installed by the United States and Saudi Arabia.\\n### Attacks on Commercial Vessels and Civilian Aircraft'], title='Malign Actors and Drones in an Age of Hybrid Conflict - Global ECCO', timestamp=None, reason_for_retrieval='case studies on use of drones missiles and artillery in hybrid warfare for infrastructure disruption', document_type=<DocumentType.DOCUMENT_TYPE_WEB_PAGE: 1>, metadata=None), RetrievedDocument(url='https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2023.2178180', excerpts=['The Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to the first large-scale, high intensity war where both sides have extensively deployed military and commercial drones. What the conflict has so far highlighted is that the frequently mentioned “game-changing effect” of drones on warfare depends on the game. Based on their category, drones produce distinctive military effects either as an extension of air power or as ammunition. Military thinking is therefore changing, making armed drones more politically acceptable. There is also reduced focus on the large armed and surveillance drones known from counterterrorism operations, as better integrated small drone scouts now serve land forces in combat. Far from being a mere security nuisance, small drones have yet to be effectively countered with air defenses. Military and dual-use export controls require adaptation to keep pace with these evolving battlefield realities. The drone lessons of the war in Ukraine thus point to many future challenges lying in wait for the international community.\\nOn the final night of 2022, Ukrainian quadcopters buzzed over the frontline town of Bakhmut and dropped bomblets on Russian soldiers across the battlefield. With thermal imaging cameras that enabled them to identify targets in pitch black conditions, these small drones flew unspotted. Meanwhile, halfway across the country in the Kyiv Oblast, dozens of Russian loitering munitions struck Ukrainian energy facilities and apartment complexes, killing up to four and psychologically terrorizing the civilian population.', 'These events are hardly isolated incidents. Drones have become an established part of conventional warfare in recent years. Russia’s war on Ukraine also shows that these uncrewed remotely controlled vehicles are a necessary, but not sufficient, capability for achieving victory in contemporary conflicts. The “game-changing effect” of drones, evoked by the media every time a new type of drone is spotted on the battlefield, however, depends on how one defines the game. This nuance helps differentiate between drones as a capability projecting airpower and drones as single-use ammunition.\\nThe large drones seen in counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and beyond, for example, do not appear to be the right systems for the war in Ukraine. The use of these drones in air operations is most effective in uncontested airspaces during asymmetric conflicts—thanks to their long endurance to perform surveillance and remote strikes. But these large aerial systems become fragile in active shooting wars when no side controls the skies.\\nIn contrast, smaller drones operated by land forces are, by their size and sheer number, transforming the dynamics of the lower airspace in Ukraine. That layer between where ground forces and bombers operate, referred to as the air littoral (Bremer and Grieco ), provides operational space for cheap loitering munitions and commercial grenade-carrying alternatives to military drones. Importantly, small drones have proven most consequential in their less sensational roles. They provide eyes in the sky and empower individual soldiers to spot enemy units and navigate artillery fire, which increases ground forces’ pace and precision and keeps troops out of harm’s way.', 'The massive number of drones deployed by armed forces surely presents some challenges. Militaries must enable drones to coordinate with each other, exchange high-volume data among themselves and with ground control stations, and execute missions in a networked fashion. For those defending against swarmed drones, the combination of hard and soft kill countermeasures has become crucial for effective anti-drone defenses. Whether drones are concentrated to overwhelm air defenses or dispersed to provide persistent surveillance over the operational theater, they contribute to the thickening of air traffic.\\n### Drone proliferation and the air littoral\\nDrones’ increased popularity and military utility manifests in congesting lower airspaces up to 3 km above the Earth’s surface (Bremer and Grieco ). Critically, cheap small drones loaded with light explosives increase the number of actors that can contest the skies. Battles now include not only the space around ground troops, but also the space immediately above them, creating minefields in the air. The widespread use of inexpensive armed and single-use attack drones could thus make close air support and ground attack aircraft even more obsolete in conflicts with denser and capable air defenses.\\nThe war has also produced a massive public relations campaign for foreign drone powers, which will almost inevitably lead to further drone proliferation (Feldstein ). Iran and Turkey are now employing drone diplomacy to chase geopolitical ambitions through armed drone sales, broadening their regional and global ties (Zanotti and Thomas ).'], title='The war in Ukraine shows the game-changing effect of drones ...', timestamp=None, reason_for_retrieval='case studies on use of drones missiles and artillery in hybrid warfare for infrastructure disruption', document_type=<DocumentType.DOCUMENT_TYPE_WEB_PAGE: 1>, metadata=None), RetrievedDocument(url='https://debuglies.com/2024/12/15/the-ascendancy-of-hybrid-warfare-analyzing-drone-activities-and-security-vulnerabilities-across-strategic-european-and-u-s-military-sites/', excerpts=['In analyzing these incidents, it is essential to consider the broader geopolitical context. Russia’s use of hybrid warfare has been a defining feature of its strategy against the West, particularly in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. This approach, which integrates cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and kinetic operations like drone flights, aims to create disruption and erode public confidence in NATO’s ability to safeguard its members. Drones, in particular, offer a low-cost, high-impact tool for intelligence gathering and sabotage, making them ideal instruments of modern hybrid warfare. The capacity of drones to navigate restricted airspace, evade detection through small size and low radar cross-section, and deliver precision payloads further enhances their appeal to adversaries seeking asymmetrical advantages.\\nThe April 2024 arrests of two German-Russian nationals further illustrate the tangible threats posed by these strategies. Accused of plotting sabotage attacks on U.S. military facilities, including the Grafenwoehr training base in Bavaria, these individuals exemplify the intersection of espionage, terrorism, and state-sponsored subversion. Their plans reportedly included bomb and arson attacks, highlighting the potential for drones to serve as both reconnaissance tools and direct attack platforms. The Grafenwoehr base, a critical site for training Ukrainian soldiers on advanced U.S.-supplied weaponry such as the M1 Abrams tank, underscores the strategic importance of these facilities and their attractiveness as targets. Such incidents highlight the necessity of integrating counter-drone measures into broader security frameworks, not only to deter direct attacks but also to identify and neutralize reconnaissance efforts before they materialize into actionable threats.', 'Ultimately, the ascendancy of drones as instruments of hybrid warfare underscores the need for a proactive, multidisciplinary approach to security. By harnessing the full spectrum of technological, regulatory, and collaborative capabilities, nations can fortify their defenses against this pervasive threat. The road ahead demands unwavering commitment, sustained innovation, and an unyielding resolve to safeguard global stability in the face of an increasingly complex threat matrix.\\n## Analytical Examination of Drone Intrusions in NATO Bases and Strategic Military Locations\\nThe persistent and methodical drone intrusions over NATO military bases and strategic locations have emerged as a focal point in modern security discourse, underscoring both the vulnerabilities of critical installations and the evolving tactics employed in hybrid warfare. These incursions, which span multiple theaters of operation, reveal an increasingly complex interplay between technological innovation and strategic subversion. Each reported event encapsulates a distinct narrative, characterized by the operational intricacies of the drones, the strategic objectives of their operators, and the implications for national and collective defense.\\n### Table – Analytical Examination of Drone Intrusions in NATO Bases and Strategic Military Locations\\nSmall unmanned aerial systems (sUAS); low-altitude, pre-programmed navigation | Surveillance of logistical operations, personnel movements, and supply chain vulnerabilities | Encrypted communication channels, autonomous navigation, evasion of electronic countermeasures | Exposed limitations of NATO’s detection systems; emphasized criticality of enhanced surveillance protocols  \\n---|---|---|---', 'The geopolitical ramifications of these advancements are equally far-reaching. Drone-enabled hybrid warfare has emerged as a favored tactic for regional powers seeking to assert influence without engaging in open conflict. By leveraging unmanned systems to conduct low-attribution operations, state actors can achieve strategic objectives while minimizing the risk of direct retaliation. These strategies often involve the systematic disruption of critical supply chains, the sabotage of energy infrastructure, or the clandestine surveillance of high-value military assets. For example, the use of drones to infiltrate adversary airbases or monitor naval deployments has become a critical component of gray-zone tactics, enabling states to project power without breaching international thresholds for conventional warfare.\\nAs a countermeasure, global defense alliances are increasingly investing in dynamic threat modeling to predict and neutralize drone-enabled incursions. These efforts emphasize the integration of multi-domain intelligence frameworks, combining geospatial analytics, electronic signal monitoring, and artificial intelligence to identify potential threats before they materialize. Predictive modeling algorithms trained on historical data sets can assess the likelihood of drone incursions based on geopolitical indicators, weather patterns, and adversary behavior, providing defense operators with actionable intelligence to preempt attacks. Such innovations are being operationalized in real-time command centers, where decision-makers can simulate various threat scenarios and calibrate responses accordingly.'], title='The Ascendancy of Hybrid Warfare: Analyzing Drone Activities and ...', timestamp=None, reason_for_retrieval='impact of drone missile artillery attacks on economic and social stability in hybrid conflicts', document_type=<DocumentType.DOCUMENT_TYPE_WEB_PAGE: 1>, metadata=None), RetrievedDocument(url='https://domesticpreparedness.com/articles/protecting-critical-infrastructure-from-weaponized-drones', excerpts=['Source: @Maxim / Adobe Stock\\n# Protecting Critical Infrastructure From Weaponized Drones\\nIn November 2024, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) thwarted an attack on the Nashville power grid by a man attempting to use an . The FBI indicated that the defendant had ordered the explosive C4 from . In the U.S., most critical infrastructure was designed and built in a relatively low-threat environment, designed to survive weather events, minimize accidents, and prevent theft, rather than built to protect against attack or sabotage. The idea that people would intentionally destroy infrastructure was generally not considered. For instance, in the energy sector, most substations were simply protected by chain link fences and signage indicating the dangers of high voltage. The reason for fencing was to deter theft and protect the public. In response to the , utilities – the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) – began to improve transmission substation security. While ballistic walls are effective at protecting transmission substations against rifle fire, this protection still leaves property vulnerable to weaponized drones attacking from above.\\nWars in Ukraine and Israel have shown how drones can be used to . In a similar fashion, transnational crime organizations embrace weaponized drones to combat rivals and police, as the use of weaponized drones is . In 2020, a drone was used in an attempt to [disrupt the U.S. power grid](https://www.wired.com/story/drone-attack-power-substation-threat/) by attacking a substation in Pennsylvania by dropping a metal cable across high-voltage lines. Fortunately, the attack was unsuccessful. However, it is only a before a drone attack disables or destroys critical infrastructure.', 'Several technologies can be used to protect infrastructure from , including large nets, net guns, radio frequency (RF) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) jamming, and cyber spoofing. Using other technologies – such as “frangible” ammunition that becomes tiny pellets when fired from conventional firearms, ground-based and aerial lasers, and RF weapons – will need additional legislation and regulation. Currently in the U.S., critical infrastructure protection is the responsibility of infrastructure owners. Protection options are limited by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations that prevent shooting down drones. Defenders can use RF jamming, GPS spoofing, and net guns for non-destructive as long as they comply with federal regulations. As counter-drone systems have been deployed in Ukraine and Russia, drone technologies have also changed. Drones are now being controlled by a of very fine fiber-optic cables up to six miles. Using fiber-optic control overcomes radio frequency detection, RF and GNSS jamming, and cyber-spoofing defenses.\\nIn Ukraine, drones with Thermite spray – a combination of aluminum and iron oxide powder – act as flying flame throwers, where Russian forces are hiding. When ignited, Thermite spray produces molten metal at about 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which can melt through the steel armor of tanks and trucks to ignite the fuel and weapons inside them. Adversaries can use the same type of drones to overcome fixed netting at substations. Thermite spray can be used to ignite the oil used in substation transformers. Napalm and white phosphorus can also be dropped from drones as incendiary weapons. Similarly, highly conductive graphene powder can be dispersed over a substation. The graphene powder short-circuits equipment, causing arcing across bushings, which can damage transformers.', 'Several technologies can actively capture or disable drones. Net guns launch nets that tangle the propellers of incoming drones, causing them to crash. These can be ground-launched or launched by defensive drones. The U.S. Army has developed an expanding net that can be launched from a standard grenade launcher.\\nFrangible ammunition can be used from rifles or radar-controlled guns to disable drones. Frangible ammo breaks into small pieces to minimize any collateral damage beyond the target. The effect is similar to skeet shooting.\\nThe U.S. Army is deploying radar-controlled guns along with laser weapons for counter-drone protection. As technology advances and costs come down, lasers or radar-controlled guns with frangible ammunition could be viable solutions to protect critical infrastructure sites.\\nThe DragonFire laser shooting at an aerial target ( ).\\nIn addition to lasers and radar-controlled guns, it is possible to defeat drones using phased array high-power microwave systems. These systems use radiated electromagnetic pulses at microwave frequencies to destroy the drone’s control electronics. The sudden change in voltage on control circuitry damages the chips in the drone control system, and the drone loses control and crashes.\\nOne concern with active-defense measures is the potential for collateral damage beyond the target. Bullets, lasers, and high-power microwave weapons require coordination with the FAA to avoid affecting aircraft. Therefore, protecting critical infrastructure in urban areas may be difficult with active-defense solutions.\\nWith the increasing sophistication of drone attacks, infrastructure owners may need to rethink how to design and build facilities. Adding concrete walls and a roof may not be suitable for many existing substations with limited space. Concrete walls require a significant below-grade foundation.

One of the most visible and innovative aspects of the Russia–Ukraine conflict has been the large-scale use of drones, which has profoundly changed the way military operations are conducted.\\nProliferation and diversification of drones. Both sides have used a wide range of drones — from adapted commercial micro-UAVs to FPV kamikaze drones, heavy aerial vehicles, and autonomous naval drones. Their low cost, the availability of commercial components, and rapid adaptability enabled industrial-scale production and mass deployment, including in swarms.\\nDrones became an integral part of the kill chain: they detect targets, transmit coordinates in real time, and guide artillery or missile strikes. Their combined use with artillery systems has significantly increased the precision and reaction speed on the battlefield.\\nThe rise of specialized formations. The escalating use of drones led both armies to create dedicated formations. As early as 2023, Ukraine launched the “Army of Drones” programme, which resulted in the creation of dedicated drone brigades and battalions with their own training, logistics, and command structures. Russia followed the same trend, forming by 2024 specialised UAV regiments and units within its ground and air forces. This marks the transition of drones from auxiliary means to stand-alone weapons with their own decision chains.\\nThe mass use of drones has forced the development of specific countermeasures. Both sides have heavily invested in:\\n  * electronic warfare (jamming, spoofing, disruption of command links and GPS/GLONASS signals);\\n  * close-range air defence (automatic cannons, optically guided machine guns, programmable ammunition, MANPADS);\\n  * improvised physical barriers (metal nets, cages, light armour on vehicles and fixed positions).', 'These measures target drones specifically and will be complemented by broader integrated air defence efforts addressed in the subchapter on air and anti-air warfare.\\nFuture conflicts will likely integrate drones as core components of armed forces rather than as mere support. The creation of dedicated units, specialized training, integration into operational planning, and adaptation of logistics are clear indicators of a major doctrinal shift.\\n.

The war has become a psychological endurance test. Massive human losses, constant shelling, the lack of regular rotations, and uncertainty about the war’s duration have gradually eroded troop morale on both sides. Despite external support, the Ukrainian army faced physical and psychological exhaustion, while the Russian army struggled with motivation issues, especially among conscripts and forcibly mobilized troops.

The Houthis hit the enemy network at key but weak (in the sense of less defended) spots. In addition to the direct financial costs of rebuilding the destroyed infrastructure, these attacks cause reputational costs, too. They show the Saudi and UAE leadership and their populations that the Houthis can hit them in their homeland, affecting the ruling elite’s reputation and conveying the political message that supporting anti-Houthi forces comes at a cost. In that sense, the cross-border attacks on civilian and economic infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the UAE can be interpreted as attempts at compellence, that is, towards shifting the decision-making calculus of the political leadership in these two states by raising the costs of continued intervention in Yemen. While this connection to the fight for territorial control in Yemen qualifies the attacks as less liquid than, for example, targeted killings in the ‘war on terror’, they are still exhibiting a significant degree liquidity, because they are directed at the enemy network (particularly oil infrastructure is seen as key node of that network), and because they are not part of a solid attack with the aim to conquer Saudi or UAE territory.\\n## Warfare of Daesh in Iraq and Syria\\n### Evolution, ideology and territorial control of Daesh', '# The impact of precision strike technology on the warfare of non-state armed groups: case studies on Daesh and the Houthis\\nBonn International Centre for Conflict Studies (BICC), Bonn, Germany\\nBonn International Centre for Conflict Studies (BICC), Bonn, Germany\\nBonn International Centre for Conflict Studies (BICC), Bonn, Germany\\n| Published online: 08 Mar 2024\\n\\nPrecision strikes from a distance are a common practice of state warfare.

The predominant view in the literature on NSAGs perceives them as would-be state builders who desire to govern and hence, seek to control territory. Our findings support this view, as both Daesh and the Houthis have applied precision strike technologies for solid warfare. However, at the same time, both groups have used these weapons for liquid warfare, too, targeting in particular civilians and civilian infrastructure to weaken the network of their enemies.

Military forces undertake a series of actions, called kill chains, which consist of collecting information on the environment, deciding what to do, and then acting. Typically, kill chains refer to a targeting cycle, which involves finding potential targets, confirming the target, precisely locating it, engaging it with a weapon, and then assessing whether the attack had the desired effect. Armed drones can perform every step in the kill chain themselves, but unarmed drones—that perform the front-end tasks in the kill chain (find, fix, track, and target) and then share this information with artillery units or other drones that fire on or engage the target—have had the biggest impact on the battlefield. In Ukraine, drones allow defenders to quickly detect an attacking force and concentrate fires on it, thereby making offensive maneuvers prohibitively costly. These drone debates, however, have not been extensively scrutinized or systematically examined across a range of cases. \\nThe authors conclude that the tempered drone optimists are correct. Drones—particularly when they are paired with other systems—are transforming the battlefield, but this is an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary change. In Ukraine, small drones are making it difficult to mass forces or conduct offensive operations, but their effects remain localized, and most drones remain piloted by humans who control and coordinate their actions. Drones are not substitutes for crewed aircraft, artillery, or missiles, but rather complements to existing weapons.

Such attacks may limit or prevent the civilian population from heat, water or electricity. Other sectors have been targeted including the Health and Agriculture sectors.\\n, besides general protection offered to civilian objects and civilians, some infrastructures benefit from a specific protection and are thus not targetable unless under specific circumstances. Those infrastructures include medical facilities, objects indispensable to the survival of the population (including foodstuffs, water installations or livestock), works and installations containing dangerous forces (including nuclear power plants), and also, cultural objects and places of worship and the natural environment (see below for more details). In any case, even if the situation would allow targeting one of those objects, rules on conduct of hostilities apply to minimize harm.Some difficulties arise when it comes to the applicability of IHL, notably regarding the geographical scope (please refer to the section \"international normative framework and the applicability of International Humanitarian Law\").', 'During armed conflict harm to civilians must be avoided to the greatest extent possible. With the use of cyber operations, the challenge is that it may be extremely difficult to assess potential harm to civilians and hence to do the calculation as to whether the harm caused to civilians is proportionate or excessive to the military objective. This is because of the interconnected nature of infrastructure, the inherently dual nature of infrastructure (which is targetable if falling under the definition of a military objective under IHL), and the difficulty to assess the impact and unintended consequences of attacks using cyber tools.\\nThis interconnected nature of cyberspace also leads to another challenge: the spillover effects as a result of cyberattacks. These can be intended or unintended consequences of actions, but either way they can impact upon protected people. Whether it is an internet shutdown or an attack against a hospital, the civilian population is at risk. Individuals can be impacted by consequences of a cyberattack even if they are not directly targeted.\\nIn IHL, the notion of harm is related to the notion of foreseeability. When preparing or launching the attack there must always be an assessment ex ante of the potential harm it could cause according to the information available at the time. To assess the final harm from the attack, one cannot only refer to the IHL notion of foreseeable harm and damage: it is important to assess the consequences of the attack on the civilian population, whether or not those operations were lawful under IHL.

What kind of damage falls under this notion? Can psychological harm be considered? And so on.', 'must be taken to protect civilians and civilian objects against the effects of cyberattacks.

Civilians may lose the legal protections afforded to them if they directly participate in the hostilities by engaging in cyberattacks.

When the threat involves the conduct of non-State actors, such as maritime militia and terrorist organizations, the existence of an international armed conflict is not obvious. This is because, as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) established in the case, their conduct does not trigger an international armed conflict unless the State exercises over the group, “not only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity” (para. 131). The State employing hybrid threats can deny the international character of the confrontation by deliberately concealing the nature and level of assistance it provides for a group of individuals as they mount a hostile campaign against the foreign target. Conflicting of Israel’s confrontation with Iran illustrate this challenge.', 'The defending State may pursue another option by characterizing the situation as a non-international armed conflict under common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. However, the ICTY in and subsequent rulings by international courts and tribunals have determined that this classification is only available when non-State actors engage in “protracted armed violence” with some degree of organization. Thus, if a hostile actor deliberately repeats isolated and sporadic acts of violence, hybrid threats could stay below the requisite threshold of intensity. In such a situation, the defending State will have no choice but to limit itself to law enforcement action to which various restrictions apply under or, in the maritime context, under of the Law of the Sea Convention, as from judicial and arbitral decisions (§ 3.11.5). If its domestic law or policy imposes stricter restrictions on the use of force in law enforcement, the State will find itself more vulnerable to these hybrid threats.\\nOn top of these legal threshold issues, political and strategic concerns about the risk of conflict escalation may impede the defending State’s ability to respond to hybrid threats in a timely and effective manner. Modern technology enables self-organized militia to engage in hostilities at various levels of intensity in different domains, such as and . These hybrid threats put law-compliant countries on the back foot as their response options are regulated within existing legal frameworks that are not flexible enough to allow for escalating the mode of operation as appropriate to the level and type of hostilities they encounter.', 'My contribution to the latest volume on hybrid threats and grey zone conflicts is an attempt to decipher the mechanism of these threats from a legal perspective.

One such path involves escaping attribution: If an action cannot be reliably attributed to a specific actor, defenders lack legal standing to retaliate (especially with force). Covert actions, cyberattacks, and proxy groups each promote such obfuscation with varying degrees of success, demanding continuous efforts to bolster attribution capabilities via intelligence and technological innovation. Another form involves normative shielding: International legal principles often conflict with each other, which enables aggressors to take advantage of those inconsistencies by using one valued principle to shield actions that violate another. For example, the principle of self-determination is often invoked to justify territorial changes (even where externally incited), and the concept of freedom of speech complicates efforts to mitigate disinformation (even in the context of election interference). Unlike wars of aggression, then, “gray zone campaigns create a vague, ambiguous environment for legal standards and judgment.” Moreover, muting opposition to an ambiguous aggression raises the likelihood that any armed response would spark public demand for the aggressor to react in kind (painting itself as the victim), which heightens the risk of escalating conflict.', 'How can international law help deter gray zone aggression?

Consider Belarus facilitating illegal migration into the European Union, China employing commercial fishing vessels to disrupt neighboring states’ activities in the South China Sea, or Russia interfering with US elections by spreading disinformation. Such gray zone activities lack the potential destructiveness of war and hence have traditionally attracted less scholarly attention, but they notably appeal to revisionists who would prefer to avoid war themselves (whether due to nuclear deterrence, economic interdependence, or other reasons). As a result, the practical likelihood of facing gray zone aggression for many countries is significantly higher than their risk of facing military invasion. How can those who seek to deter aggression short of war best shape and wield international law to serve that purpose?', 'Second, the legal concept of armed conflict facilitates efforts to limit its destructive violence via regulative norms regarding conduct in warfare (). International law demands that all uses of armed force meet the standards of discrimination, military necessity, and proportionality, and it further details protections for noncombatants including civilians, prisoners of war, medical facilities, cultural artifacts, and the environment. These norms, each of which has undergone its own history of contestation, are triggered by decisions to undertake military operations, supervening broader peacetime standards such as human rights law (). In contrast, peacetime modes of international competition such as economic rivalries for market dominance are not subject to the laws of war. Constituting shared expectations of legitimate behavior during armed conflict in this way provides focal points for condemnation by governments, domestic opposition parties, and nongovernmental organizations when those expectations are not met.'], title='Legal Deterrence by Denial: Strategic Initiative and International ...', timestamp=None, reason_for_retrieval='challenges and enforcement failures in international law regarding hybrid warfare and civilian protection', document_type=<DocumentType.DOCUMENT_TYPE_WEB_PAGE: 1>, metadata=None), RetrievedDocument(url='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9676215/', excerpts=['The consequences of war on public health are manifold and well-documented. They include outbreaks of infectious disease, injuries and deaths for soldiers and civilians, population displacement, and destabilization of essential health resources such as food, water, and sanitation []. Conflict impacts not only direct survival, but the systems that contribute to health and safety. In the past, Geneva Convention guidelines were drafted in order to protect civilian populations. The landscape has drastically changed with the advent of hybrid war. The definition of hybrid warfare is not unanimously accepted but can be seen as warfare involving conventional and non-conventional strategies with blatant disregard for civilian lives []. In this scenario, Geneva Convention guidelines are increasingly ignored or circumvented by the absence of provisions specific to these tactics. The war in Ukraine is the latest example of how hybrid war targeting civilians harms public health. Hybrid warfare brings a new era of health concerns that run the risk of unmitigated escalation. Hybrid war can damage health through use of unconventional weapons, sexual violence, military targeting of healthcare facilities and workers, forced depopulation, and sabotage of essential resources and nutrition sources, which all destabilize civilian populations.', \"A strategy for addressing hybrid warfare globally and equitably should be on the radar of agencies, politicians, and public health professionals worldwide. Its long-term public health consequences and intentional damage to civilians must be acknowledged and acted upon so they can be effectively redressed by the international community. Politicians and public health officials should advocate for a comprehensive rethinking of previous measures to ensure that guidelines of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions no longer go unanswered. If de-escalation fails, the international community and funding agencies must participate financially and logistically to reconstruct and strengthen systems. Civilian health and right to life must be respected by combatants and the global community. Failure to do so will mean this scenario will be played out with greater frequency globally. The line between combatant and civilian deaths has been blurred. Hybrid war's impact on morbidity and mortality is an avoidable erosion of the public health gains of the previous century. As a new world order is created, let us not forget to safeguard global health.\\nThe authors received no specific funding for this research.\\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\\n  * Murray C.J.L., King G., Lopez A.D., Tomijima N., Krug E.G.

It examines the challenges hybrid warfare poses to international law, the difficulties in establishing legal definitions, and the strategic responses by major powers including Russia, the United States, and China. The discussion extends to the adaptation of national and international strategies to address the gray zones of conflict that hybrid warfare exploits.

The principle of non-recognition should extend to proxy-occupied zones, even where formal annexation has not occurred, reinforcing the idea that unlawful control by indirect means cannot yield lawful status. At the same time, structured peace frameworks must explicitly exclude proxies from negotiation or governance roles. Including entities installed or maintained through unlawful force risks legitimizing aggression and undermining the rules-based order. Any viable settlement must reflect the sovereign rights of the affected State, not the strategic interests of the aggressor’s intermediaries.\\nRestorative Frameworks: Managing the Present with Legal Integrity\\n_Strategy 4: Shape Future Peace Frameworks Aligned with Legal Principles_\\nTemporary frameworks can help manage conflict without formalizing illegal territorial changes. Historical models such as the , Baltic Non-Recognition (the longstanding U.S. and allied policy of refusing to recognize the Soviet Union’s forcible annexation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania during and after World War II), and the demonstrate how temporary arrangements can create space for reintegration or future negotiation without legal recognition of territorial changes. In Europe, multilateral institutions can help monitor compliance. In frozen conflicts or ceasefire zones, stabilization agreements can prevent the re-escalation of violence while preserving future options for legitimate resolution. In the Indo-Pacific, where legal ambiguity is a strategic weapon, such frameworks may be misinterpreted as recognition. Designed carefully, stabilization frameworks provide a mechanism to hold the line diplomatically while enabling phased reintegration or autonomy without conceding sovereignty.'], title='Ukraine Symposium – War Termination: Legal Implications for ...', timestamp=None, reason_for_retrieval='challenges and enforcement failures in international law regarding hybrid warfare and civilian protection', document_type=<DocumentType.DOCUMENT_TYPE_WEB_PAGE: 1>, metadata=None)]\n"
