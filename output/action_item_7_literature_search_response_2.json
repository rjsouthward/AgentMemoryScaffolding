      "question_context": "This question targets the core empirical basis of the thesis by seeking statistical evidence on per-event fatality rates, which is necessary to assess if the claim of low casualties in these attack types is accurate and widely observed.",
      "answer": "Recent documented trends indicate a growing and severe impact of drone, missile, and artillery strikes on civilian infrastructure and populations in current conflict zones. In Ukraine for 2024, remote attacks, notably air and drone strikes, sharply increased with civilian fatalities rising by 16% compared to 2023. Over 1,600 civilians died as a result of these strikes in 2024, with aerial attacks tripling in number and frequently combined with shelling. Drone strikes were particularly deadly in regions like Kherson and the Nikopol district, where approximately 20% of drone strikes resulted in civilian fatalities, and Kharkiv became one of the most lethal regions for civilians due to these attacks[1]. \n\nIn 2025, the situation worsened with the United Nations Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine reporting that short-range drone strikes caused more civilian casualties than any other weapon, killing 58 and injuring 272 in August alone. Additionally, long-range missile and loitering munitions attacks escalated, including a peak event in early September deploying over 800 loitering munitions and 13 powerful missiles, which killed at least five civilians and injured 41 across multiple regions and Kyiv city. Civilian casualties increased by 40% in the first eight months of 2025 compared to 2024, with deaths up 17% and injuries up 46%. These attacks also targeted critical civilian infrastructure such as energy facilities and key transportation links, significantly impacting civilian wellbeing[2].\n\nIn the Tigray conflict in Ethiopia, documented air and drone strikes resulted in 1,143 casualties, with approximately one-third resulting in death. Vulnerable groups such as children (28%) and women (45%) were disproportionately affected. Casualties occurred predominantly in civilian-populated areas including marketplaces, IDP camps, and health facilities, highlighting the direct targeting of non-combatants[3]. \n\nGlobally, explosive violence including missile and artillery shelling affected civilians in 74 countries in 2024, with the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) accounting for over 60% of reported civilian fatalities from explosive weapons. Outside of OPT, civilian fatalities from such weapons increased more than 60% in 2024, notably in Lebanon, Myanmar, Syria, and Ukraine. Attacks on healthcare increased by 64%, attacks on education more than doubled, and attacks on humanitarian aid nearly quintupled compared with 2023. These trends exemplify a broader deterioration of civilian protection and adherence to international humanitarian law[4][5].\n\nLong-range bombardment and artillery remain major contributors to civilian casualties. Data show 6,617 battle-related events involving long-range attacks caused 43,520 civilian deaths, with many civilians killed in areas devoid of military fatalities \u2014 indicating extensive impact on civilian populations rather than direct military engagements[6]. \n\nOverall, recent conflict zones are witnessing rising fatality rates and casualty numbers from drone, missile, and artillery strikes on civilian infrastructure. Per-event fatality rates are substantial, especially for drone attacks in frontline areas, where up to 20% of strikes lead to fatalities, and for airstrikes, where approximately one-third result in death. The scale and frequency of attacks are increasing, disproportionately affecting women, children, and vulnerable groups, while targeting civilian infrastructure critical to basic needs and survival, suggesting a widespread pattern of deliberate or reckless harm to civilians[1][2][3][4][6].",

            "Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians reached an all-time high in 2024, with an over 30% increase in the total number of remote attacks leading to civilian casualties amid . ACLED estimates that over 1,600 civilians have died as a result of these attacks in 2024 \u2014 16% more than in 2023. Unlike in the first two years of the invasion, an ever-growing share of these attacks in 2024 was caused by air and drone strikes, as Russian forces scaled up the use of aerial glide bombs along the border and the frontline, and the use of Shahed-type drones across the rest of the country. In 2024, the number of aerial attacks against civilians more than tripled, of which over a quarter were combined with shelling. The number of remote attacks increased sharply in July at the height of Russia\u2019s attempt to seize the remainder of the Donetsk region and peaked in August and September as Ukraine mounted a counter-offensive into Russia\u2019s own Kursk region ().",
            "As was the case in 2023, most attacks on civilians occurred in the smaller part of the Kherson region on the right bank of the Dnipro river, which remains under Ukrainian control. The number of these attacks increased by a third in 2024, with drones becoming a weapon of choice. Drones typically send a real-time video feed to their operators, suggesting deliberate targeting of civilians. Similarly, the number of drone strikes on remaining civilians quadrupled in the Nikopol district of the Dnipropetrovsk region facing the Russian-occupied city of Enerhodar, which hosts the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) across the river. Approximately one in five drone strikes in the Nikopol district resulted in civilian fatalities. As Russia ramped up cross-border strikes with its aerial glide bombs, Kharkiv became the most deadly region for Ukrainian civilians after Donetsk in 2024, while Sumy entered the top four after surpassing Zaporizhia and Dnipropetrovsk. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Russian forces expanded the glide bomb campaign against Zaporizhia city, leading to a sharp increase in civilian casualties there.\n## Russia\u2019s attacks on civilian infrastructure\n### The war on housing, education, and health care\nViolent incidents targeting infrastructure in Ukraine"

            "# Civilian Casualties Remain Alarmingly High as Short and Long-Range Weapons Devastate Lives Across Ukraine, UN Human Rights Monitors Say\nKyiv, 10 September \u2013 In August, short-range drone strikes caused more civilian casualties in Ukraine than any other weapon, killing 58 civilians and injuring 272, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said today. A n covering August 2025 indicates that around 72% of all casualties occurred near the frontline, primarily in Donetsk and Kherson regions.\nIn addition to intensifying frontline attacks, the use of long-range weapons (missiles and loitering munitions) against areas far from the frontline significantly increased in 2025, with the trend continuing in September after a pause in August. \n\u201cThe temporary pause in long-range attacks during early August provided only brief relief to urban areas, while civilian casualties in frontline regions remained consistently high,\u201d said Danielle Bell, who heads HRMMU. \u201cEarly September brought renewed attacks, with the Russian Federation reportedly deploying record numbers of missiles and drones.\u201d\nDuring the attack on 6\u20137 September, Russian armed forces reportedly deployed 810 loitering munitions and 13 powerful missiles, marking the highest number of munitions used in a single attack since 24 February 2022. The strike affected multiple regions across the country, resulting in at least 5 civilians killed and 41 injured in 6 regions and Kyiv city. \nIn August 2025, attacks on energy infrastructure, particularly gas facilities, intensified, with at least nine incidents documented in areas controlled by the Government of Ukraine. The month also saw strikes on other critical infrastructure, including powerful airstrikes on Korabelnyi bridge in Kherson city\u2014vital for civilian movement and logistics\u2014which triggered evacuations. \n\u201cThese attacks risk disrupting essential services and compounding civilian hardship, especially as winter approaches,\u201d Bell noted.",

Civilian deaths rose by 17%, while civilian injuries surged by 46%. \nSince the start of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation in Ukraine on 24 February 2022, HRMMU has documented at least 14,116 civilians killed, including 733 children, and 36,481 injured, including 2,285 children. \n### UN entities involved in this initiative\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n## Goals we are supporting through this initiative"

It includes lack of access to food, health care, housing, employment, and clean water and sanitation, as well as loss of community and homes. IDPs, usually poorer migrants who lack the finances to travel abroad, often face grossly inadequate living conditions and experience high rates of malnutrition and mental health challenges; their lack of access to healthcare has particularly serious consequences for maternal, infant, and child mortality.

Attacks being \u2033shared and celebrated\u2033 included on commuters, people at bus stops, and on children playing in parks. This terror campaign has become known as the \u2033Human Safari\u2033. One of the instances described as a \u2033typical case\u2033 was a Ukrainian mother-of-two who was cycling home when a Russian drone spotted her and followed her until dropping a grenade, which injured her with shrapnel, leaving her unable to walk. Imagery of the attack was posted on a Russian Telegram channel with a winking face emoji and falsely describing her as a soldier. \nIn July 2025, local authorities said a one-year-old boy who was staying with his great-grandmother in had been struck by a Russian drone. The child died on the scene from injuries sustained by the explosion, while his grandmother was injured by the same drone. The attack was part of a wider attack on Kherson, also wounding 17 people across the region. \nOther than targeting individual civilians, Russian drones using a napalm-like mixture to start fires burning down entire neighbourhoods, and scattering mines powerful enough to destroy a tire or blow a foot off have also been noted. \nThe former village of within has been the target of several Russian attacks making use of to deliberately target civil to cause as much devastation to the local civilian population as possible, and have led to several civilian deaths.

            "Of the total of 1,143 casualties from airstrikes reported, sadly, one third of the airstrikes resulted in death. In addition to the direct effects of aerial and drone attacks, further loss of life occurred due to lack of access to treatment after the airstrike due to attacks on healthcare facilities in the region and lack of medical supplies caused by a de facto blockade, which have left over 85% of hospitals and health centers in the region incapacitated [,,,]. Socio-demographic analysis of casualties in our dataset demonstrated that nearly half (45%) of airstrike victims were female and 28% were children. In addition to the airstrike, Tigrayan females, were also severely affected by gender-based violence during the war [,,]. This highlights the multifaceted impact of the war on Tigrayan women, as they not only endure the immediate physical threats of aerial and drone strikes but also suffer from the pervasive and traumatic consequences of gender-based violence [].",
            "This study sheds light on the distribution and effects of drone and armed aerial strikes on civilians in the Tigray war. However, the study had several limitations. First, the nature of available data were limited by the variables (i.e., death and injury) collected in district health facility registers and reported to the regional health bureau following airstrikes. This prevented us from reporting on more granular data such as anatomic region of injury or outcomes other than injury/death. Second, our study only accounted for casualties resulting directly from attacks, and individuals affected by secondary effects may not be captured in our data. Third, the complete communications blackout during the conflict made data collection and quality monitoring difficult. Consequently, there is potential for underreporting of drone attacks. Finally, our study encompassed a limited geographic range and time period due to its focus on airstrike-related casualties as well as constraints on data collection inherent to conflict. For example, the present study was unable to consider Western Tigray due to its occupation by other forces with associated security issues and lack of access. This study therefore represents only a small portion of the total 600,000 deaths reported in Tigray []. Nonetheless, this report provides important insight into patterns of airstrike-related injury among vulnerable civilian populations in the Tigray war.",
            "A total of 1,143 casualties from airstrikes were reported from six zones and 24 districts of Tigray, Ethiopia. From the total of 80 instances of drone and aerial bombardments incidents, one third of the airstrikes resulted in death (33.7%, = 385). The mean age of the victims was 28.9 years (SD = 17.9) with a range of less than 1 year to 87 years. Almost a third of the victims (28.3%, = 323) were children aged < 18 years. Approximately 5% of casualties were age > 60 years (5.3%, = 61). Almost half (45.1%, = 516) of the causalities were female including pregnant and lactating women. The Southern and Northwest zones suffered the most casualties, followed by the Southeast zones and Mekelle. The airstrikes took place predominantly in civilian areas, including marketplaces, internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, residential areas, public transportation, villages, children\u2019s playgrounds, churches, mills and hospitals, resulting in numerous casualties that disproportionately affected civilians, especially children, the elderly and women.\nCivilians suffered significant death and injury from airstrikes during hostilities in the war in Tigray, including a high proportion of women and children. The most common targets were civilian facilities including IDP camps, which the United Nations has determined to be a crime against humanity. Enhanced collaboration between health and protection stakeholders can improve support to victims from immediate post-injury care as well as rehabilitation so that they can live as healthy, dignified, and productive citizens."

These predictions are almost invariably premature. The use of antitank weapons in Ukraine was initially received as signaling the death of armor. The arrival of mass unmanned platforms on land, sea, and air, likewise, has been accompanied by predictions of the death of platforms such as advanced tactical aircraft and ships. The advent of numerous means of non-kinetic and electronic warfare has been occasioned by predictions that they will render traditional kinetic fires, if not a thing of the past, at least less important than they have been.\n> The future of warfare will likely be characterized by an increased demand signal for offensive and defensive fires.\nArtillery has long been known as the \u201cking of battle,\u201d and for good reason. In virtually every major land conflict for centuries, artillery and missilery have accounted for the vast majority of casualties. Instead of becoming less relevant, the future of warfare will likely be characterized by an increased demand signal for offensive and defensive fires.",
            "Trends affecting the demand for fires include the diffusion of precision guidance and its marriage with pervasive surveillance and targeting abilities. In a transparent battlefield, anything can be targeted, and in a world full of precision-guided munitions, everything will be. Weapon systems development likewise reflects these trends. Today, virtually all rockets are equipped with guidance of some kind, and almost all gravity bombs are smart bombs.\nThe reign of fires, both offensive and defensive, is at little risk of being toppled. Today\u2019s new missile age is defined by a surge in the global supply and demand for a spectrum of standoff strike capability and the means to counter it. Air defenses and long-range missiles have consistently been the Ukrainian government\u2019s top two requests for aid. The United States has significantly increased spending on long-range strike since Russia\u2019s 2014 invasion and occupation of Crimea, and this trend is unlikely to change anytime soon (Figure 6.1). Air and missile defense (AMD) and long-range precision fires are likewise the top-two modernization priorities for allied countries such as Australia and Japan.\nDirector, Missile Defense Project and Senior Fellow, Defense and Security Department\nProgram Coordinator and Research Assistant, Missile Defense Project"

Notably, in 41,858 of 54,239 (77.17 percent) events coded as battle-related but involving civilian deaths (183,910 in total), the GED reports fatalities for belligerents in the relevant dyad.

We conducted a keyword search of the text of the \u201csource_article\u201d variable in the GED for terms relating to long-range bombardment, including iterations of the following: , and *. We identified 6,617 events displaying these terms, plausibly involving long-range bombardment. These events involved 43,520 civilian deaths, all coded as battle-related with no belligerent fatalities. In comparison, when we conducted keyword searches of events coded as one-sided violence, we identified only 279 events and 2,135 civilian deaths.\nTo demonstrate how information and shape coding practices in cases of aerial bombardment and long-range shelling\u2014modalities of war already disproportionately possessed by states\u2014we turn next to illustrative examples from two GED conflict events in Sri Lanka and Ethiopia, respectively."

In 2023, there were 59 state-based armed conflicts, the highest ever recorded since 1946, when began. In 2023, 220 out of 369 conflicts worldwide\u2014about 60 per cent\u2014were , up from 216 out of 363 the previous year. continued to experience the highest number of conflicts classified as full-scale wars.\nCivilians are bearing the brunt of these conflicts, which are characterized by blatant disregard for international humanitarian and human rights law, including mass atrocities. Over 58,700 civilians have already been killed in conflict in 2024, with civilian fatalities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT) accounting for nearly 31 per cent of the global total, followed by Sudan and Myanmar, according to the . Tragically, with conflicts continuing to escalate in places like OPT, Sudan, and Ukraine, 2024 could match or even surpass the devastating death toll in 2023, when over 63,000 civilians were killed in wars. Humanitarians, however, remain on the ground in the most challenging conflicts. Four out of every five civilian fatalities in conflicts worldwide in 2024 have occurred in countries with a humanitarian plan or appeal.",
            "The rising use of explosive weapons in populated areas has had catastrophic consequences for civilians, especially children. On average, civilians make up 90 percent of those harmed by attacks involving [explosive weapons in populated areas](https://www.unocha.org/explosive-weapons-populated-areas#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20explosive%20weapons,in%20populated%20areas%20are%20civilians.). In 2023, nearly 30,000 civilians were or injured by explosive weapons in just six conflicts: Myanmar, OPT, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen. Children are uniquely by explosive weapons, and can be at least seven times more likely to from blast injuries than adults. Between 2018 and 2022, explosive weapons were responsible for nearly half of the more than 47,500 instances of killed and maimed in more than 24 conflict zones globally, as verified by the United Nations. During the same period, explosive weapons killed or seriously injured almost twice as many children as were killed or injured by gunshots and other firearms.",
            "Explosive weapons also drastically increase damage to civilian infrastructure during war, as seen during Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, OPT. More than half of \u2019s homes, 80 per cent of commercial facilities, 87 per cent of school buildings and 68 per cent of cropland have been damaged or destroyed, while health facilities have been systematically attacked. There are worrying indications that these trends are being repeated in , where 99,000 housing units and 36 water facilities have been destroyed or damaged, impacting the homes of hundreds of thousands of people and water supply for nearly 402,000 people. The UN Secretary-General continues to urge parties to conflict and States to avoid using explosive weapons in populated areas, relocate conflicts away from urban centers, and refrain from placing military objectives within or near densely populated areas. He also calls for the signing and implementation of the [Political Declaration on Strengthening the Protection of Civilians from the Humanitarian Consequences Arising from the Use of Explosive Weapons in Populated Areas](https://ewipa.org/the-political-declaration).\nUnexploded ordnance can be found on many streets and intersections across Gaza, often close to schools and other public spaces, posing severe risks to residents."

      "question": "Is there evidence in military strategy literature or official doctrine indicating a shift from mass casualty tactics to persistent disruption, economic attrition, and destabilization via high-precision technological attacks?",
      "question_context": "Answering this will establish whether there is scholarly or strategic consensus or debate around the purported shift in warfare goals and methods, directly supporting or challenging the thesis.",
      "answer": "There is evidence in military strategy literature and official doctrine indicating a shift from traditional mass casualty tactics toward strategies emphasizing persistent disruption, economic attrition, and destabilization through high-precision technological attacks. This shift is particularly observable in the context of contemporary irregular and asymmetric warfare.\n\nFirst, analysis of non-state armed groups (NSAGs) like Daesh and the Houthis shows that the proliferation of precision strike technologies, including missiles and armed drones, enables these actors to perform \"liquid warfare.\" This form of warfare focuses not on territorial conquest (solid warfare) but on weakening enemy networks and targeting civilians and infrastructure to disrupt socio-political order, reflecting high-precision, targeted operations rather than mass casualty tactics[1].\n\nSecond, official U.S. military doctrine and reports indicate evolving approaches consistent with this shift. The doctrine known as Adaptive Power emphasizes sustained, low-friction activities\u2014such as legal capacity building, data sharing, and border-security cooperation\u2014to build influence ecosystems. These activities prioritize agility, legitimacy, and enduring presence rather than conventional large-scale combat[2]. Furthermore, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and related Department of Defense documents frame Irregular Warfare (IW) as a strategy involving nontraditional methods like sabotage, subversion, terrorism, and cyber operations. These methods aim to disrupt or negate adversary capabilities across legal, informational, economic, and security domains and to influence populations without traditional territorial domination[3]. \n\nThese doctrines and strategic concepts emphasize persistent disruption, economic attrition, and destabilization by leveraging precision strikes and non-kinetic means, rather than focusing solely on destruction of enemy forces through mass casualties. However, some literature clarifies that \u201cattrition\u201d itself is not formally a type of warfare but a characterization of conflict where destruction is employed pragmatically to create tactical or strategic advantages. Destruction-oriented warfare, which combines movement with firepower, remains valid but is supplemented by these emerging modes of competition emphasizing disruption and influence[4].\n\nFinally, the broader strategic environment, characterized by \"gray-zone competition,\" demands flexible, modular approaches aligned with local contexts and rhythms. This further supports a movement away from mass casualty, decisive battle paradigms toward continuous, high-precision, and multi-domain campaign activities designed to erode adversary cohesion and legitimacy over time[2][3].\n\nIn summary, both military scholarly literature and official doctrine reflect and codify a notable shift from direct, mass casualty engagements to warfare strategies focused on persistent disruption, economic attrition, and destabilization achieved through high-precision technological means and comprehensive influence operations.\n\n[1] Bonn International Centre for Conflict Studies (BICC), \"The impact of precision strike technology on the warfare of non-state armed groups,\" 2024.  \n[2] dkiapcss.edu, \"Adaptive Power: A Doctrine for Strategic Influence in the Era of Gray-Zone Competition.\"  \n[3] congress.gov, National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and Department of Defense doctrine on Irregular Warfare.  \n[4] warontherocks.com, \"Attrition is not a form of warfare,\" discussion on destruction-oriented warfare and attrition.",

            "# The impact of precision strike technology on the warfare of non-state armed groups: case studies on Daesh and the Houthis\nBonn International Centre for Conflict Studies (BICC), Bonn, Germany\nBonn International Centre for Conflict Studies (BICC), Bonn, Germany\nBonn International Centre for Conflict Studies (BICC), Bonn, Germany\n| Published online: 08 Mar 2024\n\nPrecision strikes from a distance are a common practice of state warfare. However, the global proliferation of precision strike technologies, like missiles and armed drones, makes such weapons progressively available to non-state armed groups (NSAGs). We look at Daesh in Syria and Iraq and at the Houthis in Yemen as two case studies to analyse the consequences of this proliferation for non-state warfare. Our focus is the socio-spatial dimension of warfare. We probe to what extent precision strike technology is used to conquer and control territory (solid warfare) or to weaken the enemy network without territorial ambition (liquid warfare). The predominant view in the literature on NSAGs perceives them as would-be state builders who desire to govern and hence, seek to control territory. Our findings support this view, as both Daesh and the Houthis have applied precision strike technologies for solid warfare. However, at the same time, both groups have used these weapons for liquid warfare, too, targeting in particular civilians and civilian infrastructure to weaken the network of their enemies. This poses new questions to scholars of small wars and insurgencies and calls upon policy makers to increase efforts to curb the proliferation of precision strike technologies.",
            "As military technology proliferates, non-state armed groups (NSAGs) like Hezbollah, Hamas and others can procure the means by which they can attack their opponents from a safe distance, too. This is well documented. However, research on the consequences of this on the socio-spatial dimension of NSAGs\u2019 warfare is lacking. We seek to close this gap and ask: What is the impact of precision strike technology on the socio-spatial dimension of non-state armed groups\u2019 warfare? To answer this question, we build on the distinction between \u2018solid\u2019 and \u2018liquid warfare\u2019, according to which solid warfare\u2019s goal is military conquest and control of territory, while liquid warfare seeks to destroy enemy networks and avoid territorial confinement. Based on the literature on NSAGs, we should expect that these groups make use of precision strike technology to support the conquest and control of territory; i.e. that they apply it for solid warfare. Research on NSAGs has convincingly argued that most of these groups, even though they differ in many aspects, are would-be state-builders that must gain control over territory in order to govern. And even those NSAGs that are rather \u2018commercial insurgencies\u2019 depend on the control of at least some territory.",
            "This finding is highly relevant for scholars of small wars and insurgencies, because it draws attention to a new strategic option for NSAGs that comes along with the proliferation of precision strike technologies, posing a series of new questions that broaden the research agenda on NSAGs, e.g. with regard to conflict escalation, NSAGs military success, and the consequences for civilians. While answering all these questions is beyond the scope of this article, we sketch out this research agenda in the conclusion and provide some hints regarding conflict escalation and the consequences for civilians. In particular the latter should be of interest to the policy community, too. As the proliferation of precision strike technology turns civilians not only into reachable but also \u2018logical\u2019 targets (in a liquid warfare strategy), this proliferation and in particular strategies to curb it should receive more attention by policy makers.\nIn the next section, we introduce the typology of solid/liquid warfare and relate it to NSAGs warfare. Then we discuss the two cases, first the Houthis and then Daesh, to analyse the impact of remote warfare technology on the socio-spatial dimension of their warfare. We sum up our findings in the conclusion and sketch out some policy option to curb the proliferation of remote warfare technology to NSAGs, based on the empirical findings of our two cases.\n## Two socio-spatial dimensions of NSAGs\u2019 warfare"

This study examines how the mastery of new technology shapes the dynamics of warfare and informs effective decision-making strategies. Our methodology is grounded in a model-based approach. We begin with Lanchester\u2019s square law model, which provides a framework for analyzing modern combat scenarios involving long-range weapons. To extend this framework, we incorporate the Bass diffusion model, enabling the simultaneous examination of the progression of the conflict and the learning curve associated with the new technology. Subsequently, we utilize insights from studying the adoption of a single technology to analyze the introduction of multiple new technologies provided by different suppliers. In this context, considerations of technological effectiveness and supplier reliability become critical in making balanced procurement decisions. To support this process, we propose a Market Share Attraction model to guide decision-making effectively.\nNo data was used for the research described in the article.\n\u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Military personnel will continue in a normal duty status, without pay, until such time as a continuing resolution or appropriations are passed by Congress and signed into law. Civilian personnel not engaged in excepted activities will be placed in a non-work, non-pay status. \n# Adaptive Power: A Doctrine for Strategic Influence in the Era of Gray-Zone Competition\nIn an increasingly contested Indo-Pacific region, traditional frameworks of hard and soft power no longer offer sufficient strategic traction. Joseph Nye\u2019s served the post\u2013Cold War order. However, today\u2019s gray-zone environment, marked by fragmented sovereignty, systemic fragility, and contested legitimacy, demands a more adaptive and operationally attuned framework. This paper introduces Adaptive Power, a next-generation doctrine of influence built on five interdependent pillars: Timing, Context, Legitimacy, Modularity, and Learning. Unlike Smart Power\u2019s static balance of tools, Adaptive Power emphasizes agility, strategic rhythm, and the contextual fit of influence across domains and timeframes.\nIt incorporates emerging security principles such as systemic fragility, resilience, enabling influence, and consultative planning, grounded in years of Indo-Pacific field observation and strategic wargaming. The doctrine responds directly to adversaries\u2019 use of Sharp Power\u2014covert, coercive, and manipulative influence\u2014by offering a coherent, legitimacy-driven alternative. Tailored to U.S. and allied competition in the gray zone, Adaptive Power aligns with Department of Defense priorities to campaign in competition, strengthen partner resilience, and evolve deterrence strategy in a fractured security landscape.",
            "For much of the modern era, U.S. military power and strategic leadership have played a central role in sustaining global security and deterring large-scale conflict. Today, that role is being tested in new ways, and some go so far as to say that the U.S. is in decline (Adams, 2024). The Indo-Pacific region has become the principal arena for strategic competition, where revisionist powers seek to challenge longstanding norms through coercive influence, incremental encroachments, and hybrid operations short of war. States face fragmented sovereignty, cross-domain threats, contested legitimacy, and a fractured information environment.\nIn this evolving environment, the effectiveness of U.S. deterrence and influence is shaped less by the scale of its assets and more by how those assets are employed\u2014when, where, and with what degree of legitimacy and responsiveness. Adversaries are operating across legal, informational, economic, and security domains to exploit systemic gaps, shape perceptions, and shift balances of power without triggering direct confrontation. This has revealed critical vulnerabilities in static models of power projection and signaled the need for an updated strategic framework.",

            "As the wars in Gaza and Ukraine illustrate, attrition is a characterization of conflict and not a form of warfare. Attrition is an adjective used to provide meaning to engagements, battles, campaigns, operations, and wars in which destruction is high. Moreover, attrition lacks a coherent body of knowledge and an accepted set of practical applications that would allow it to be considered a form of warfare. Therefore, it is prudent to accept that attrition warfare is not actually a typology. Rather, it is a misnomer that needs to be rectified. Replacing attrition in all cases in which the defense and security studies community, as well as military practitioners, are not outlining an activity\u2019s character is paramount. The term destruction-oriented warfare is an appropriate replacement for attrition\u2019s use in regard to a form of warfare.\nFurther, Western militaries must graduate beyond fanciful and idealist thinking about armed conflict. The destruction of hostile armies is how a military creates the situation required for their policymakers to pursue strategic victory. In some instances, however, that is not the case. The threat of, or the bludgeoning push toward the destruction of, a hostile army generates the signal for hostile policymakers to negotiate an end to armed conflict.\nSo long as large-scale wars between industrialized states continue, and destruction-oriented methods remain the path to military, and subsequently political, victory, then the defense and security studies communities must come around to understanding attrition and its place in the conduct of armed conflict. As Nolan us, the destruction of armies, or the push toward destroying armies, is the most effective and historically supportable way in which to drive policymakers to the negotiating table.",
            "It is important to understand these broadly held myths about conflict because, if left unchecked, they will continue to lead to calamitous missteps in planning policy and executing military strategy. They also prevent international organizations from properly preparing for the deleterious impact of warfighting, precision strategy or not. Those four myths include: 1) attrition is a form of warfare, 2) attrition is a correlation of forces and means battle, 3) attrition is focused on a one-to-one exchange ratio between adversaries, and 4) attrition is a lesser form of warfare. Examining these misunderstandings about attrition reveals two critical things: First, attrition is not a form of warfare, but a characterization of conflict in which one or more sides uses the pragmatic employment of destruction-based tactics and operations to create or take advantage of tactical and strategic opportunities on the battlefield. Further, it is important to remember that destruction-based warfare is not movement-agnostic. Rather, destruction-based approaches are grounded in the combination of movement to enable firepower.\nSecond, one form of warfare does not carry an inherent advantage over another. Rather, forms of warfare organically evolve to the situational requirement(s). As a result, a form of warfare\u2019s value resides in its ability to best address the military situation at hand, and not in its adherence to a state military\u2019s preferred doctrine.",
            "## Assertion 1: Attrition is a form of warfare\nMany in the defense and security studies space community imply that attrition is a form or method of warfare. This cannot be further from the truth. In a military thinking sense, a \u201cform,\u201d \u201cmethod,\u201d or \u201ctype\u201d implies that the subject possesses a cohered body of knowledge and a set of operations and tactics. These ideas \u2014 the body of knowledge and operations and tactics \u2014 might be institutionally developed and maintained, or organically developed by a theorist working outside the confines of an institution. These ideas might be codified as strategy, concepts, or doctrine, if maintained by an institution, such as a Western military force. On the other hand, these ideas might be codified as theory, if they are maintained by scholars, analysts, or theorists. A review of both and army operations doctrine finds no substantial mention of attrition or attrition warfare.\nGiven the absence in Western military doctrine, as well as defense and security studies or international relations scholarship, of discussion regarding \u201cattrition warfare,\u201d one must surmise that the word attrition is describing an environment in which destruction is the currency of conflict, and not a form, style, or type of warfare."

In IW, a less powerful adversary seeks to disrupt or negate the military capabilities and advantages of a more powerful military force, which usually serves that nation's established government. Because of its emphasis on influencing populations, actions to control the IE, to include actions in cyberspace, play a prominent role in IW.\nIW includes, among other activities, the specific missions of unconventional warfare (UW), stabilization, foreign internal defense (FID), counterterrorism (CT), and counterinsurgency (COIN). \n, Section 1097, National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY2016, defines UW as \"activities conducted to enable a resistance movement or insurgency to coerce, disrupt, or overthrow a government or occupying power by operating through or with an underground, auxiliary, or guerrilla force in a denied area.\" UW is a core component of IW.\nCOIN are \"comprehensive civilian and military efforts designed to simultaneously defeat and contain insurgency and address its root causes.\"\nRelated activities such as military information support operations (MISO) or psychological operations, cyberspace operations, countering threat networks, counter-threat finance, civil-military operations, and security cooperation also shape the information environment and other population-focused arenas of competition and conflict.",

      "question": "What specific examples or case studies illustrate the use of drones, missiles, and artillery for long-term infrastructure disruption and hybrid warfare objectives, and what impact have these attacks had on economic and social stability?",
      "question_context": "This question addresses whether actual attack campaigns support the thesis of hybrid warfare aimed at sustained disruption rather than mass casualties, filling a gap in concrete evidence and real-world outcomes.",
      "answer": "Several specific examples and case studies illustrate the use of drones, missiles, and artillery in hybrid warfare aimed at long-term infrastructure disruption rather than solely mass casualties. Russia\u2019s attacks on Ukraine represent a prominent case where drones have been employed extensively against critical energy infrastructure, including power grids and dams, to degrade the country\u2019s strategic resources. These attacks have caused power blackouts and disrupted supplies while also delivering psychological terror to civilian populations, as seen in strikes on energy facilities and urban apartment complexes that resulted in fatalities and widespread fear[1][2]. Similarly, Russia and Ukraine have targeted each other\u2019s energy sectors since the invasion began, aiming at sustained infrastructure degradation[1].\n\nNon-state actors like Hamas and Houthi rebels also utilize drones and unmanned underwater vehicles to attack offshore installations, such as Israel\u2019s gas platforms and maritime traffic in the Red Sea. For example, in September 2019, a sophisticated combined swarm attack employing 18 drones and seven cruise missiles by Houthi insurgents targeted Saudi Arabia\u2019s Aramco oil facilities, temporarily shutting down five percent of the global oil supply and triggering a 20 percent spike in oil prices. This attack successfully defeated advanced U.S.-installed Patriot air defense systems, demonstrating drones\u2019 increasing ability to penetrate high-level defenses[1][3].\n\nIn the United States, there have been attempts to use drones for infrastructure sabotage, such as a July 2020 incident where a DJI Mavic 2 drone tried to short-circuit a Pennsylvania electrical substation, though it failed[1][4]. The FBI thwarted a 2024 attempt to attack the Nashville power grid with explosives delivered by drone, underscoring the growing vulnerability of critical infrastructure that was originally designed without consideration for intentional sabotage[4]. \n\nIn Ukraine, small drones equipped with weapons like Thermite spray have been deployed to destroy Russian armored vehicles and could similarly burn electrical substation transformers, illustrating the integration of drones with kinetic artillery effects on the battlefield[4][2]. Drone swarms have become a tactical norm, contributing to increased artillery precision and faster reaction times on the front lines, as evidenced by the creation of dedicated \u201cdrone brigades\u201d and UAV regiments by both Ukrainian and Russian forces[3].\n\nThe impact of these attacks on economic and social stability is profound. Attacks on energy infrastructure induce power blackouts, disrupt supply chains, and interrupt telecommunications, causing both immediate physical damage and long-term societal distress[1]. For example, Russia\u2019s destruction of Ukrainian agricultural capacity and blockade of wheat exports precipitated a global food crisis affecting distant regions like South Asia and Africa[1]. The Al Aramco attack imposed significant financial burdens and geopolitical shocks, destabilizing oil markets and signaling the vulnerabilities of global energy networks[1][5]. \n\nPsychologically, these strikes erode public confidence in governments\u2019 ability to protect essential services and infrastructure, increasing social anxiety and undermining morale. The hybrid warfare approach utilizes such economic disruption and psychological effects as strategic tools to pressure political leadership, as seen in Houthi attacks targeting Saudi Arabia and UAE oil infrastructure to raise costs of intervention in Yemen[5][6]. Drone incursions over NATO bases and strategic military sites have similarly highlighted critical gaps in defense and contributed to a broader perception of vulnerability, affecting alliance cohesion and deterrence credibility[7][6].\n\nMoreover, the proliferation and mass deployment of drones have forced changes in military doctrine and infrastructure design to address vulnerability. Defensive measures such as electronic warfare jamming, specialized physical barriers, and emerging technologies like laser weapons and high-power microwave systems are being deployed to counteract these threats[4][3].\n\nIn sum, the case studies from Ukraine, the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, and attempts in the United States demonstrate a clear trend in hybrid warfare where drones, missiles, and artillery are systematically used to achieve long-term infrastructure disruption. These campaigns have significant economic consequences by damaging critical supply chains and energy networks and induce social instability via psychological terror and diminished public trust in security[1][4][2][7][3][5][6].",

            "Russia\u2019s illegal and relentless attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy networks and dams are certainly the best-known contemporary cases of drone attacks on critical infrastructure, but they are hardly unique. Drones have become an ever-present threat near critical US infrastructure, including nuclear facilities, electrical grids, and even the White House, prompting new legislation and counter-UAS authorities and tools for the Department of Homeland Security and other domestic security agencies. July 2020 marked the first publicized drone attack attempt on a US facility, when a DJI Mavic 2 drone narrowly failed in an attack that appeared to be aimed at short-circuiting a Pennsylvania electrical substation. This is likely to be the first of many future attempts, as US critical infrastructure remains an attractive, vulnerable, and almost inevitable target. \nAs drones evolve the capability to autonomously navigate, carry larger payloads, and operate across domains, they become ideal tools for malicious actors. Deep-diving unmanned underwater vehicles are becoming more sophisticated and more readily available, making undersea cables and offshore infrastructure increasingly attractive targets. Hamas is known to possess drone submarines that it uses to target Israel\u2019s offshore gas platforms, and Houthi rebels are confirmed to have added unmanned underwater vehicles to their arsenal. The effects of critical infrastructure attacks are potentially devastating and may include power blackouts, supply chain disruptions, and telecommunication system interruptions. \n> Beyond the apparent and immediate physical damage, the psychological impact of a drone attack cannot be overstated.",
            "Adversaries employ hybrid tactics to target strategic resources, obliquely or overtly. Despite prohibitions under international law, strategic denial of access to essential goods, including food, water, and energy, is becoming distressingly commonplace and generates global consequences. Russia\u2019s deliberate destruction of Ukraine\u2019s agricultural production capacity and blockade of Ukrainian wheat exports created a global food crisis that has particularly affected South Asian and African nations far away from the battlefield. The United States destroyed ISIS-controlled oil fields in Syria and Iraq in 2015 and 2016, while both Russia and Ukraine have targeted each other\u2019s energy resources since Russia\u2019s invasion began.",
            "Non-state actors certainly recognize the shock effect of strategic resource disruption and have successfully carried out drone-enabled attacks to produce it. In September 2019, for example, the Aramco Abqaiq oil facilities in Saudi Arabia were hit by a combined swarm attack consisting of 18 drones and seven cruise missiles. Houthi insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack, although given the level of sophistication and precision, most Western analysts at the time assumed some level of Iranian government involvement. Regardless of the source, the attack achieved devastating outcomes by temporarily shutting down five percent of the world\u2019s oil supply, which led to as much as a 20 percent increase in global oil prices. This swarm attack was especially disturbing because it defeated a robust, state-of-the-art air defense system that had been installed by the United States and Saudi Arabia; the system included Patriot missile batteries, and was intended to protect the facility and surrounding oil fields. Combined swarms of drones and missiles appear to be emerging as a favored mode of attack for Iran and so-called Iran-affiliated \u201cresistance forces,\u201d as further evidenced by the massive swarm attack aimed at Israel on 13 April 2024 and regular Houthi-initiated volleys targeting maritime traffic in the Red Sea.\n> This swarm attack was especially disturbing because it defeated a robust, state-of-the-art air defense system that had been installed by the United States and Saudi Arabia.\n### Attacks on Commercial Vessels and Civilian Aircraft"

            "The Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to the first large-scale, high intensity war where both sides have extensively deployed military and commercial drones. What the conflict has so far highlighted is that the frequently mentioned \u201cgame-changing effect\u201d of drones on warfare depends on the game. Based on their category, drones produce distinctive military effects either as an extension of air power or as ammunition. Military thinking is therefore changing, making armed drones more politically acceptable. There is also reduced focus on the large armed and surveillance drones known from counterterrorism operations, as better integrated small drone scouts now serve land forces in combat. Far from being a mere security nuisance, small drones have yet to be effectively countered with air defenses. Military and dual-use export controls require adaptation to keep pace with these evolving battlefield realities. The drone lessons of the war in Ukraine thus point to many future challenges lying in wait for the international community.\nOn the final night of 2022, Ukrainian quadcopters buzzed over the frontline town of Bakhmut and dropped bomblets on Russian soldiers across the battlefield. With thermal imaging cameras that enabled them to identify targets in pitch black conditions, these small drones flew unspotted. Meanwhile, halfway across the country in the Kyiv Oblast, dozens of Russian loitering munitions struck Ukrainian energy facilities and apartment complexes, killing up to four and psychologically terrorizing the civilian population.",
            "These events are hardly isolated incidents. Drones have become an established part of conventional warfare in recent years. Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine also shows that these uncrewed remotely controlled vehicles are a necessary, but not sufficient, capability for achieving victory in contemporary conflicts. The \u201cgame-changing effect\u201d of drones, evoked by the media every time a new type of drone is spotted on the battlefield, however, depends on how one defines the game. This nuance helps differentiate between drones as a capability projecting airpower and drones as single-use ammunition.\nThe large drones seen in counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and beyond, for example, do not appear to be the right systems for the war in Ukraine. The use of these drones in air operations is most effective in uncontested airspaces during asymmetric conflicts\u2014thanks to their long endurance to perform surveillance and remote strikes. But these large aerial systems become fragile in active shooting wars when no side controls the skies.\nIn contrast, smaller drones operated by land forces are, by their size and sheer number, transforming the dynamics of the lower airspace in Ukraine. That layer between where ground forces and bombers operate, referred to as the air littoral (Bremer and Grieco ), provides operational space for cheap loitering munitions and commercial grenade-carrying alternatives to military drones. Importantly, small drones have proven most consequential in their less sensational roles. They provide eyes in the sky and empower individual soldiers to spot enemy units and navigate artillery fire, which increases ground forces\u2019 pace and precision and keeps troops out of harm\u2019s way.",
            "The massive number of drones deployed by armed forces surely presents some challenges. Militaries must enable drones to coordinate with each other, exchange high-volume data among themselves and with ground control stations, and execute missions in a networked fashion. For those defending against swarmed drones, the combination of hard and soft kill countermeasures has become crucial for effective anti-drone defenses. Whether drones are concentrated to overwhelm air defenses or dispersed to provide persistent surveillance over the operational theater, they contribute to the thickening of air traffic.\n### Drone proliferation and the air littoral\nDrones\u2019 increased popularity and military utility manifests in congesting lower airspaces up to 3 km above the Earth\u2019s surface (Bremer and Grieco ). Critically, cheap small drones loaded with light explosives increase the number of actors that can contest the skies. Battles now include not only the space around ground troops, but also the space immediately above them, creating minefields in the air. The widespread use of inexpensive armed and single-use attack drones could thus make close air support and ground attack aircraft even more obsolete in conflicts with denser and capable air defenses.\nThe war has also produced a massive public relations campaign for foreign drone powers, which will almost inevitably lead to further drone proliferation (Feldstein ). Iran and Turkey are now employing drone diplomacy to chase geopolitical ambitions through armed drone sales, broadening their regional and global ties (Zanotti and Thomas )."

          "excerpts": [
            "In analyzing these incidents, it is essential to consider the broader geopolitical context. Russia\u2019s use of hybrid warfare has been a defining feature of its strategy against the West, particularly in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. This approach, which integrates cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, and kinetic operations like drone flights, aims to create disruption and erode public confidence in NATO\u2019s ability to safeguard its members. Drones, in particular, offer a low-cost, high-impact tool for intelligence gathering and sabotage, making them ideal instruments of modern hybrid warfare. The capacity of drones to navigate restricted airspace, evade detection through small size and low radar cross-section, and deliver precision payloads further enhances their appeal to adversaries seeking asymmetrical advantages.\nThe April 2024 arrests of two German-Russian nationals further illustrate the tangible threats posed by these strategies. Accused of plotting sabotage attacks on U.S. military facilities, including the Grafenwoehr training base in Bavaria, these individuals exemplify the intersection of espionage, terrorism, and state-sponsored subversion. Their plans reportedly included bomb and arson attacks, highlighting the potential for drones to serve as both reconnaissance tools and direct attack platforms. The Grafenwoehr base, a critical site for training Ukrainian soldiers on advanced U.S.-supplied weaponry such as the M1 Abrams tank, underscores the strategic importance of these facilities and their attractiveness as targets. Such incidents highlight the necessity of integrating counter-drone measures into broader security frameworks, not only to deter direct attacks but also to identify and neutralize reconnaissance efforts before they materialize into actionable threats.",
            "Ultimately, the ascendancy of drones as instruments of hybrid warfare underscores the need for a proactive, multidisciplinary approach to security. By harnessing the full spectrum of technological, regulatory, and collaborative capabilities, nations can fortify their defenses against this pervasive threat. The road ahead demands unwavering commitment, sustained innovation, and an unyielding resolve to safeguard global stability in the face of an increasingly complex threat matrix.\n## Analytical Examination of Drone Intrusions in NATO Bases and Strategic Military Locations\nThe persistent and methodical drone intrusions over NATO military bases and strategic locations have emerged as a focal point in modern security discourse, underscoring both the vulnerabilities of critical installations and the evolving tactics employed in hybrid warfare. These incursions, which span multiple theaters of operation, reveal an increasingly complex interplay between technological innovation and strategic subversion. Each reported event encapsulates a distinct narrative, characterized by the operational intricacies of the drones, the strategic objectives of their operators, and the implications for national and collective defense.\n### Table \u2013 Analytical Examination of Drone Intrusions in NATO Bases and Strategic Military Locations\nSmall unmanned aerial systems (sUAS); low-altitude, pre-programmed navigation | Surveillance of logistical operations, personnel movements, and supply chain vulnerabilities | Encrypted communication channels, autonomous navigation, evasion of electronic countermeasures | Exposed limitations of NATO\u2019s detection systems; emphasized criticality of enhanced surveillance protocols  \n---|---|---|---",
            "The geopolitical ramifications of these advancements are equally far-reaching. Drone-enabled hybrid warfare has emerged as a favored tactic for regional powers seeking to assert influence without engaging in open conflict. By leveraging unmanned systems to conduct low-attribution operations, state actors can achieve strategic objectives while minimizing the risk of direct retaliation. These strategies often involve the systematic disruption of critical supply chains, the sabotage of energy infrastructure, or the clandestine surveillance of high-value military assets. For example, the use of drones to infiltrate adversary airbases or monitor naval deployments has become a critical component of gray-zone tactics, enabling states to project power without breaching international thresholds for conventional warfare.\nAs a countermeasure, global defense alliances are increasingly investing in dynamic threat modeling to predict and neutralize drone-enabled incursions. These efforts emphasize the integration of multi-domain intelligence frameworks, combining geospatial analytics, electronic signal monitoring, and artificial intelligence to identify potential threats before they materialize. Predictive modeling algorithms trained on historical data sets can assess the likelihood of drone incursions based on geopolitical indicators, weather patterns, and adversary behavior, providing defense operators with actionable intelligence to preempt attacks. Such innovations are being operationalized in real-time command centers, where decision-makers can simulate various threat scenarios and calibrate responses accordingly."

            "Source: @Maxim / Adobe Stock\n# Protecting Critical Infrastructure From Weaponized Drones\nIn November 2024, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) thwarted an attack on the Nashville power grid by a man attempting to use an . The FBI indicated that the defendant had ordered the explosive C4 from . In the U.S., most critical infrastructure was designed and built in a relatively low-threat environment, designed to survive weather events, minimize accidents, and prevent theft, rather than built to protect against attack or sabotage. The idea that people would intentionally destroy infrastructure was generally not considered. For instance, in the energy sector, most substations were simply protected by chain link fences and signage indicating the dangers of high voltage. The reason for fencing was to deter theft and protect the public. In response to the , utilities \u2013 the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) \u2013 began to improve transmission substation security. While ballistic walls are effective at protecting transmission substations against rifle fire, this protection still leaves property vulnerable to weaponized drones attacking from above.\nWars in Ukraine and Israel have shown how drones can be used to . In a similar fashion, transnational crime organizations embrace weaponized drones to combat rivals and police, as the use of weaponized drones is . In 2020, a drone was used in an attempt to [disrupt the U.S. power grid](https://www.wired.com/story/drone-attack-power-substation-threat/) by attacking a substation in Pennsylvania by dropping a metal cable across high-voltage lines. Fortunately, the attack was unsuccessful. However, it is only a before a drone attack disables or destroys critical infrastructure.",
            "Several technologies can be used to protect infrastructure from , including large nets, net guns, radio frequency (RF) and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) jamming, and cyber spoofing. Using other technologies \u2013 such as \u201cfrangible\u201d ammunition that becomes tiny pellets when fired from conventional firearms, ground-based and aerial lasers, and RF weapons \u2013 will need additional legislation and regulation. Currently in the U.S., critical infrastructure protection is the responsibility of infrastructure owners. Protection options are limited by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations that prevent shooting down drones. Defenders can use RF jamming, GPS spoofing, and net guns for non-destructive as long as they comply with federal regulations. As counter-drone systems have been deployed in Ukraine and Russia, drone technologies have also changed. Drones are now being controlled by a of very fine fiber-optic cables up to six miles. Using fiber-optic control overcomes radio frequency detection, RF and GNSS jamming, and cyber-spoofing defenses.\nIn Ukraine, drones with Thermite spray \u2013 a combination of aluminum and iron oxide powder \u2013 act as flying flame throwers, where Russian forces are hiding. When ignited, Thermite spray produces molten metal at about 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which can melt through the steel armor of tanks and trucks to ignite the fuel and weapons inside them. Adversaries can use the same type of drones to overcome fixed netting at substations. Thermite spray can be used to ignite the oil used in substation transformers. Napalm and white phosphorus can also be dropped from drones as incendiary weapons. Similarly, highly conductive graphene powder can be dispersed over a substation. The graphene powder short-circuits equipment, causing arcing across bushings, which can damage transformers.",
            "Several technologies can actively capture or disable drones. Net guns launch nets that tangle the propellers of incoming drones, causing them to crash. These can be ground-launched or launched by defensive drones. The U.S. Army has developed an expanding net that can be launched from a standard grenade launcher.\nFrangible ammunition can be used from rifles or radar-controlled guns to disable drones. Frangible ammo breaks into small pieces to minimize any collateral damage beyond the target. The effect is similar to skeet shooting.\nThe U.S. Army is deploying radar-controlled guns along with laser weapons for counter-drone protection. As technology advances and costs come down, lasers or radar-controlled guns with frangible ammunition could be viable solutions to protect critical infrastructure sites.\nThe DragonFire laser shooting at an aerial target ( ).\nIn addition to lasers and radar-controlled guns, it is possible to defeat drones using phased array high-power microwave systems. These systems use radiated electromagnetic pulses at microwave frequencies to destroy the drone\u2019s control electronics. The sudden change in voltage on control circuitry damages the chips in the drone control system, and the drone loses control and crashes.\nOne concern with active-defense measures is the potential for collateral damage beyond the target. Bullets, lasers, and high-power microwave weapons require coordination with the FAA to avoid affecting aircraft. Therefore, protecting critical infrastructure in urban areas may be difficult with active-defense solutions.\nWith the increasing sophistication of drone attacks, infrastructure owners may need to rethink how to design and build facilities. Adding concrete walls and a roof may not be suitable for many existing substations with limited space. Concrete walls require a significant below-grade foundation. One option is to use composite panels for ballistic protection."

One of the most visible and innovative aspects of the Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict has been the large-scale use of drones, which has profoundly changed the way military operations are conducted.\nProliferation and diversification of drones. Both sides have used a wide range of drones \u2014 from adapted commercial micro-UAVs to FPV kamikaze drones, heavy aerial vehicles, and autonomous naval drones. Their low cost, the availability of commercial components, and rapid adaptability enabled industrial-scale production and mass deployment, including in swarms.\nDrones became an integral part of the kill chain: they detect targets, transmit coordinates in real time, and guide artillery or missile strikes. Their combined use with artillery systems has significantly increased the precision and reaction speed on the battlefield.\nThe rise of specialized formations. The escalating use of drones led both armies to create dedicated formations. As early as 2023, Ukraine launched the \u201cArmy of Drones\u201d programme, which resulted in the creation of dedicated drone brigades and battalions with their own training, logistics, and command structures. Russia followed the same trend, forming by 2024 specialised UAV regiments and units within its ground and air forces. This marks the transition of drones from auxiliary means to stand-alone weapons with their own decision chains.\nThe mass use of drones has forced the development of specific countermeasures. Both sides have heavily invested in:\n  * electronic warfare (jamming, spoofing, disruption of command links and GPS/GLONASS signals);\n  * close-range air defence (automatic cannons, optically guided machine guns, programmable ammunition, MANPADS);\n  * improvised physical barriers (metal nets, cages, light armour on vehicles and fixed positions).",
            "These measures target drones specifically and will be complemented by broader integrated air defence efforts addressed in the subchapter on air and anti-air warfare.\nFuture conflicts will likely integrate drones as core components of armed forces rather than as mere support. The creation of dedicated units, specialized training, integration into operational planning, and adaptation of logistics are clear indicators of a major doctrinal shift.\n. Both sides have invested massively in jamming communications, GPS, and drone control signals.\nElectronic warfare has proven to be an \u201cinvisible weapon\u201d with direct effects on coordination capability and the effectiveness of artillery or drones.Ukrainians benefited from Western support, while Russians quickly adapted mobile jamming systems.\nno technological advantage is secure if the adversary possesses an effective electronic countermeasures capability.\ng) The human factor \u2013 morale, discipline, and troop resilience. Although the Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict has been marked by rapid technological advances, battlefield experience has shown that the human factor remains decisive in war, as in all major past conflicts.\nMorale and will to fight. The war has become a psychological endurance test. Massive human losses, constant shelling, the lack of regular rotations, and uncertainty about the war\u2019s duration have gradually eroded troop morale on both sides. Despite external support, the Ukrainian army faced physical and psychological exhaustion, while the Russian army struggled with motivation issues, especially among conscripts and forcibly mobilized troops. Maintaining the will to keep fighting proved essential to holding the front.\nUnits that maintained discipline, cohesion, and mutual trust between commanders and soldiers performed better, even under conditions of technical or numerical inferiority. Experience showed that small, well-trained, and motivated units can resist larger forces, especially in positional warfare.",
            "The conflict has confirmed that regardless of the level of technology and automation, war remains a collective human endeavour. Morale, discipline, and troop resilience must be treated as central elements in planning and conducting operations, at the same level as logistics, intelligence, and firepower.\n\n## h) Lessons for the future\n  * Modern war does not exclude the return to \u201cclassic\u201d forms of fighting when technology faces well-organized defences.\n  * Artillery and anti-tank weapons reaffirm their central role.\n  * Logistics and infrastructure (roads, railways, depots) are major vulnerabilities.\n  * Territorial defence based on fortifications and mines remains a force multiplier.\n  * The transparency of the battlefield through drones and satellites makes large-scale force concentrations impossible without major risks.\n  * Electronic and cyber warfare complement the classical arsenal, sometimes neutralizing the adversary\u2019s technological advantages.\n  * The cheap attack drone is becoming a central actor, comparable to traditional artillery, but dependent on continuous logistical and informational flows.\n\n. Land operations in Ukraine demonstrate that advanced technology and modern reconnaissance methods have not eliminated the static and bloody nature of positional warfare.\nArtillery, fortifications, and logistics dominate the battlefield, and success depends on integrating mobility with precision strikes and doctrinal adaptation to an extremely \u201ctransparent\u201d environment.\nThe current conflict illustrates the emergence of a form of hybrid warfare in which trenches and artillery barrages coexist with drones, electronic jamming, and real-time intelligence \u2014 and where tactical improvisation is just as important as strategic planning."

            "In sum, while the Houthis\u2019 use of ballistic missiles and drones to attack coalition troops and military bases in Yemen can be classified as solid warfare, their precision strikes on targets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE represent a form of liquid warfare. The cross-border attacks on civilian and economic infrastructure, including maritime infrastructure and oil tankers, in particular, are not intended to provide the ground for a conventional attack or the conquest of territory. The Houthis hit the enemy network at key but weak (in the sense of less defended) spots. In addition to the direct financial costs of rebuilding the destroyed infrastructure, these attacks cause reputational costs, too. They show the Saudi and UAE leadership and their populations that the Houthis can hit them in their homeland, affecting the ruling elite\u2019s reputation and conveying the political message that supporting anti-Houthi forces comes at a cost. In that sense, the cross-border attacks on civilian and economic infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and the UAE can be interpreted as attempts at compellence, that is, towards shifting the decision-making calculus of the political leadership in these two states by raising the costs of continued intervention in Yemen. While this connection to the fight for territorial control in Yemen qualifies the attacks as less liquid than, for example, targeted killings in the \u2018war on terror\u2019, they are still exhibiting a significant degree liquidity, because they are directed at the enemy network (particularly oil infrastructure is seen as key node of that network), and because they are not part of a solid attack with the aim to conquer Saudi or UAE territory.\n## Warfare of Daesh in Iraq and Syria\n### Evolution, ideology and territorial control of Daesh",

However, the global proliferation of precision strike technologies, like missiles and armed drones, makes such weapons progressively available to non-state armed groups (NSAGs). We look at Daesh in Syria and Iraq and at the Houthis in Yemen as two case studies to analyse the consequences of this proliferation for non-state warfare. Our focus is the socio-spatial dimension of warfare. We probe to what extent precision strike technology is used to conquer and control territory (solid warfare) or to weaken the enemy network without territorial ambition (liquid warfare). The predominant view in the literature on NSAGs perceives them as would-be state builders who desire to govern and hence, seek to control territory. Our findings support this view, as both Daesh and the Houthis have applied precision strike technologies for solid warfare. However, at the same time, both groups have used these weapons for liquid warfare, too, targeting in particular civilians and civilian infrastructure to weaken the network of their enemies. This poses new questions to scholars of small wars and insurgencies and calls upon policy makers to increase efforts to curb the proliferation of precision strike technologies."

Technically defined as aircraft systems operated without a human pilot onboard, UAVs integrate avionics, propulsion, communications, and mission-specific payloads (electro-optical, infrared, EW modules, loitering munitions, etc.) into a remotely piloted or autonomous system capable of executing precision operations in contested and denied environments. Their ability to provide real-time Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR), perform kinetic strikes, conduct electronic warfare, and support logistics in high-risk zones has significantly redefined force projection and tactical engagement doctrines."

      "question": "What quantitative evidence exists regarding changes in economic output, public services, and social indicators in regions affected by persistent drone, missile, and artillery strikes, and how do these align with the thesis of long-term attrition and destabilization?",
      "question_context": "This question targets a major remaining gap\u2014the direct quantitative link between technological strike campaigns and specific economic/social disruption outcomes. Filling this gap is essential to fully substantiate the thesis\u2019s claim that such attacks yield long-term attrition and destabilization beyond casualty figures.",
      "answer": "Quantitative evidence reveals that regions affected by persistent drone, missile, and artillery strikes experience measurable declines in economic output, public services, and social indicators consistent with long-term attrition and destabilization. In Pakistan, U.S. drone strikes have been statistically linked to increased unemployment, as demonstrated through Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) modeling that combined drone strike data with employment surveys from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics[1]. This evidences that beyond casualties, drone strikes produce economic disruption by damaging infrastructure and reducing civilian employment opportunities[1].\n\nIn Ukraine, the extensive use of persistent long-range weaponry, including over 19,000 missiles and 14,700 one-way attack drones (such as Iran-adapted Shahed drones), provides quantitative data illuminating attritional effects on both military defenses and civilian life. Despite a less than 10% hit rate by these drones, their low cost enables mass salvos that saturate air defenses, require expensive countermeasures, and terrorize urban populations, forcing frequent sheltering and creating disruption in daily life[2]. The cost analysis comparing missiles and drones underscores this attritional logic: interceptors like the Patriot cost millions per shot, whereas drone costs are comparatively minimal, allowing for sustained pressure on Ukrainian infrastructure and population morale[2].\n\nUN Human Rights Monitoring Mission data further quantifies social impacts. In August 2025 alone, drone strikes caused 58 civilian deaths and 272 injuries, concentrated heavily near frontlines in Donetsk and Kherson, with civilians at risk from intensified attacks on critical infrastructure like gas facilities and vital bridges[3]. Throughout 2025, civilian casualties in Ukraine increased sharply\u2014total casualties rose 40%, with deaths up 17% and injuries by 46% compared to 2024\u2014signifying worsening social trauma and disruption linked to these persistent strikes[3].\n\nFurther, precision strike technologies employed by non-state armed groups such as Daesh and the Houthis illustrate complex socio-spatial warfare impacts that extend beyond territorial conquest to targeting civilian infrastructure in 'liquid warfare' strategies, designed to weaken enemy networks socio-politically and economically. This technology proliferation enables remote warfare that degrades public services and fuels destabilization by making civilian populations \u2018logical\u2019 targets, undermining social stability[4].\n\nThis multifaceted evidence from diverse conflict zones aligns with the thesis that technological strike campaigns result in long-term attrition and destabilization effects. The economic downturns (unemployment increases), degradation of public infrastructure, escalating civilian casualties, and ongoing disruption of essential services each provide quantitative support for the assertion that persistent drone, missile, and artillery strikes extend their impact well beyond immediate battlefield casualty figures towards sustained socio-economic and political destabilization[1][2][3][4].",

Most of these one-way attack drones were \u2014a system imported from Iran and adapted by Russia to include new guidance systems and electronic countermeasures. These drones have a 2,000 kilometer (km) range and carry a 40 kilogram high explosive payload. And they are relatively cheap. Though estimates vary, each Shahed is estimated to cost $35,000 per drone.\nWhile Ukraine has continued to adapt ingenious ways for countering swarms of loitering one-way attack drones over the course of the war, the Shahed retains a cruel attritional logic. It is the most cost-effective munition in Russia\u2019s firepower strike arsenal. Even though Shahed\u2019s only hit their target less than 10 percent of the time, their low cost means Russia can fire mass salvos almost daily, wearing down Ukrainian air defenses and terrorizing the population.\nThis installment of the explores the cost-effectiveness of long-range attack drones used in the Russia-Ukraine war. worked with a research team at the University of Texas to analyze compiled from Ukrainian air force social media by .

            "The data compiled by the research team demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of long-range, one-way attack drones. Despite seeing large numbers of these systems shot down by Ukrainian air defenders, they remain the cheapest way to generate effects in Moscow\u2019s firepower strike arsenal. This cruel logic explains why from September through December 2024, Russia launched more one-way attack drones against targets in Ukraine than in the preceding 23 months combined. If Russia can sustain this launch rate for its precision bombardment campaign, Ukraine will need a steady supply of low-cost countermeasures and more help impeding Russian access to drone components. And these systems are . And the United States will need to learn from Ukraine how to counter one-way attack drones while investing in its own family of low-cost, long-distance attack systems like the proposed \u2014Pentagonese for a low-cost cruise missile under development\u2014and Anduril\u2019s new class of . Based on data from Ukraine, low-cost will likely prove cost-effective and create new options in .\nAs seen in the chart below, Russia increasingly relies on one-way attack drones to sustain its attack on Ukrainian and political centers consistent with their concept of and using long-range precision strike assets. Every night, these systems cause millions of Ukrainians to head to bomb shelters and mobile air defense crews and electronic warfare teams to move into position. The Shaheds are used as much to saturate air defenses as they are to attack targets, cluttering radar screens and forcing command centers to make decisions about where to fire their more capable surface-to-air missiles like the Patriot.\nU.S. Army War College, Clements Center for National Security\nGraduate Student, Masters of Science in Information Technology & Management program, University of Texas\nGraduate Student, Masters of Science in Information Technology & Management program, University of Texas",
            "To put these numbers in , a Patriot interceptor (PAC-3) is over 3 million dollars while a NASAM (AIM 9-X variant) is slightly over 1 million dollars. This means firing a NASAM to intercept a cruise missile (Kh-22 or Kh-59) is cost-effective. Using it against a one-way attack drone carries a significant loss of value (over $600,000 per interceptor). These numbers are compounded when one factors the time it takes to modern Western interceptors and the of production lines compared to the relative ease Moscow has found in adapting plants to mass produce one-way attack drones. Even though the United States has of AIM-9X by 18 percent (137 produced per month) and PAC-3 by 116 percent (48 per month), it is still on the wrong side of the cost curve based on insights from Ukraine.\nIn terms of dollars per pound of munition delivered, our analysis showed missiles are much more efficient than Shahed drones. The Kh-22, for example, carries a payload of around 2,200 lbs. However, a Shahed\u2019s 110-pound payload can do significant damage that is sufficient for many targets. There are also secondary benefits. Shahed salvos place a tax on air defense teams that can create attack windows for other missiles to get through. They also terrorize the population, sending Ukrainians every night to bomb shelters in major urban centers.\nFinally, the data do not differentiate among genuine Shahed-136/Geran-2 drones, of a similar type, and , which Russia frequently launches alongside Shahed drones to distract Ukraine\u2019s air defenses. If a significant proportion of the \u201cShahed drones\u201d intercepted are cheaper drones and decoys, Russia could be employing their Shahed drones more cost-effectively than our analysis suggests."

            "In between these two extremes, there is a third camp that argues that drones have been most effective when used with other capabilities, such as artillery, to rapidly close kill chains. Military forces undertake a series of actions, called kill chains, which consist of collecting information on the environment, deciding what to do, and then acting. Typically, kill chains refer to a targeting cycle, which involves finding potential targets, confirming the target, precisely locating it, engaging it with a weapon, and then assessing whether the attack had the desired effect. Armed drones can perform every step in the kill chain themselves, but unarmed drones\u2014that perform the front-end tasks in the kill chain (find, fix, track, and target) and then share this information with artillery units or other drones that fire on or engage the target\u2014have had the biggest impact on the battlefield. In Ukraine, drones allow defenders to quickly detect an attacking force and concentrate fires on it, thereby making offensive maneuvers prohibitively costly. These drone debates, however, have not been extensively scrutinized or systematically examined across a range of cases. \nThe authors conclude that the tempered drone optimists are correct. Drones\u2014particularly when they are paired with other systems\u2014are transforming the battlefield, but this is an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary change. In Ukraine, small drones are making it difficult to mass forces or conduct offensive operations, but their effects remain localized, and most drones remain piloted by humans who control and coordinate their actions. Drones are not substitutes for crewed aircraft, artillery, or missiles, but rather complements to existing weapons. As drones more broadly share real-time information, become more autonomous, and shape doctrine and organizational structures, they may revolutionize warfare, but that day is yet to come.",

This question is at the heart of the drone revolution debate in security studies. Proponents of a drone revolution argue that drones provide \u2018game-changing characteristics\u2019, act as \u2018magic bullets\u2019 against adversaries, and even provide the key defence to decide the \u2018fate of nations\u2019. Sceptics disagree, arguing that no matter the nuances or contexts of war, drones can never be considered the primary determinant of victory. In this article, we argue that the two sides of the debate rest upon a false dichotomy \u2013 that technologies must either be revolutionary or evolutionary. We reappraise country-specific case studies used by both sides of the debate: the Ethiopia\u2013Tigray War, the Houthi\u2013Saudi War, and the Russia\u2013Ukraine War. Our analysis reveals a welcome synthesis; the impact of drone employment depends on the types of war waged, the drone capabilities deployed, and the political objectives sought in each conflict. In this sense, drones can have an impact on war that is sometimes ordinary and sometimes revolutionary. It is only by clarifying the analytical scope of the debate that the impact of drones on the practice of war can be fully understood.",
            "If drones \u2018decide the fate of nations\u2019, we should expect that their acquisition creates distinct military and political advantages for the acquiring state. In other words, a technology that performs this role alters \u2018the capacity of states to create and project military power\u2019. Michael Boyle suggests that armed drone proliferation outside of the Western world will function like the aircraft before it and reset \u2018the terms of competition\u2019 by \u2018introducing a degree of uncertainty into regional balances of power\u2019. While for Boyle the impact of drones is most heavily felt in their political nature \u2013 the technology increases uncertainty between states, their low cost makes aggression easier to risk and accidental military incidents more likely \u2013 it signals the significance of drone acquisition for developing nations. Other scholars have pointed to both the defensive capabilities of drones when integrated into an overall air defence system, as well as suggesting that drone surveillance capability could have a significant impact on the nuclear stability between small nuclear states. None of this quite answers the question of whether drones can decide the fate of a nation or be the primary determinant in a state\u2019s survival. Though it is clear that sceptics of a game change as well as the magic bullet theory would take issue with such a claim, this area of the drone revolution remains largely unresearched.",
            "In the remaining sections of the paper, this contextual typology for drone employment will be applied to three distinct contemporary cases of drone use \u2013 the Russia\u2013Ukraine War, the Ethiopian Civil War, and the Saudi\u2013Houthi conflict \u2013 assessing the technology\u2019s battlefield impact in each case. Questions of the impact of drones of modern battlefields are obviously contemporary, and so finding enough information to make any useful assessment on the matter can be difficult. Such high-profile cases, utilised widely by proponents and sceptics, motivate the generation of knowledge around the event both in popular culture and scholarly literature. Their common use in the drone debate also makes them ideal, relevant choices to help highlight the synthesis we propose. As such, the cases were selected to conduct a structured, focused comparison of wars in which drones have played a significant role. The object is to uncover under what conditions drones may have a determining impact on the outcome of a conflict \u2013 are they game-changers, magic bullets, or deciders of the fates of nations? The cases reveal that variations in political objectives and conflict type allow drones to have an impact on war that is sometimes ordinary and sometimes revolutionary. In short, by analysing the nuances of the debating scholars\u2019 own cases, our findings partly confirm the sceptics\u2019 point of view; drones seem ordinary in conventional state-to-state conflicts. Yet when deployed in non-Western and non-conventional conflicts, drones support the proponents\u2019 views \u2013 drones can be the primary determinants of victory in certain conflicts. Whether the drone revolution really is a revolution, then, depends on where one looks."

            "#  Civilian Casualties Remain Alarmingly High as Short and Long-Range Weapons Devastate Lives Across Ukraine, UN Human Rights Monitors Say\nKyiv, 10 September \u2013 In August, short-range drone strikes caused more civilian casualties in Ukraine than any other weapon, killing 58 civilians and injuring 272, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) said today. A n covering August 2025 indicates that around 72% of all casualties occurred near the frontline, primarily in Donetsk and Kherson regions. \nIn addition to intensifying frontline attacks, the use of long-range weapons (missiles and loitering munitions) against areas far from the frontline significantly increased in 2025, with the trend continuing in September after a pause in August. \n\u201cThe temporary pause in long-range attacks during early August provided only brief relief to urban areas, while civilian casualties in frontline regions remained consistently high,\u201d said Danielle Bell, who heads HRMMU. \u201cEarly September brought renewed attacks, with the Russian Federation reportedly deploying record numbers of missiles and drones.\u201d\nDuring the attack on 6\u20137 September, Russian armed forces reportedly deployed 810 loitering munitions and 13 powerful missiles, marking the highest number of munitions used in a single attack since 24 February 2022. The strike affected multiple regions across the country, resulting in at least 5 civilians killed and 41 injured in 6 regions and Kyiv city. \nIn August 2025, attacks on energy infrastructure, particularly gas facilities, intensified, with at least nine incidents documented in areas controlled by the Government of Ukraine. The month also saw strikes on other critical infrastructure, including powerful airstrikes on Korabelnyi bridge in Kherson city\u2014vital for civilian movement and logistics\u2014which triggered evacuations. \n\u201cThese attacks risk disrupting essential services and compounding civilian hardship, especially as winter approaches,\u201d Bell noted.",
            "Throughout 2025, civilian harm has risen sharply, with total casualties in the first eight months of the year increasing by 40% compared to 2024. Civilian deaths rose by 17%, while civilian injuries surged by 46%. \nSince the start of the full-scale invasion of the Russian Federation in Ukraine on 24 February 2022, HRMMU has documented at least 14,116 civilians killed, including 733 children, and 36,481 injured, including 2,285 children. \n##### For media inquiries, please contact Kris Janowski, Spokesperson +380952300437, krzysztof.janowski@un.org\n\u00a9 UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine"

            "# The impact of precision strike technology on the warfare of non-state armed groups: case studies on Daesh and the Houthis\nBonn International Centre for Conflict Studies (BICC), Bonn, Germany\nBonn International Centre for Conflict Studies (BICC), Bonn, Germany\nBonn International Centre for Conflict Studies (BICC), Bonn, Germany\n| Published online: 08 Mar 2024\n\nPrecision strikes from a distance are a common practice of state warfare. However, the global proliferation of precision strike technologies, like missiles and armed drones, makes such weapons progressively available to non-state armed groups (NSAGs). We look at Daesh in Syria and Iraq and at the Houthis in Yemen as two case studies to analyse the consequences of this proliferation for non-state warfare. Our focus is the socio-spatial dimension of warfare. We probe to what extent precision strike technology is used to conquer and control territory (solid warfare) or to weaken the enemy network without territorial ambition (liquid warfare). The predominant view in the literature on NSAGs perceives them as would-be state builders who desire to govern and hence, seek to control territory. Our findings support this view, as both Daesh and the Houthis have applied precision strike technologies for solid warfare. However, at the same time, both groups have used these weapons for liquid warfare, too, targeting in particular civilians and civilian infrastructure to weaken the network of their enemies. This poses new questions to scholars of small wars and insurgencies and calls upon policy makers to increase efforts to curb the proliferation of precision strike technologies.",
            "Remote warfare has become an important feature of state warfare, as states frequently prefer to avoid their own boots on the ground and generate \u2018physical and political distance\u2019 between themselves and the area of intervention. They support local forces through training, equipment, advice or intelligence. A central element of remote warfare are precision strikes from a distance, conducted with the help of military technologies like armed drones, missiles and precision-guided bombs. While the level of precision of these weapon systems differs \u2013 e.g. cruise missiles and drones are usually more precise than ballistic missiles \u2013 they enable purposeful attacks on selected targets over a long distance. Several authors see democratic states as particularly inclined to resort to remote warfare, as their governments fear the risk of not getting re-elected should a war result in many casualties and high economic costs. However, we can observe remote warfare by autocratic states, too, as the cases of Russia\u2019s involvement in Syria, Saudi Arabia in Yemen or Iranian proxy warfare across the Middle East demonstrate.",
            "This finding is highly relevant for scholars of small wars and insurgencies, because it draws attention to a new strategic option for NSAGs that comes along with the proliferation of precision strike technologies, posing a series of new questions that broaden the research agenda on NSAGs, e.g. with regard to conflict escalation, NSAGs military success, and the consequences for civilians. While answering all these questions is beyond the scope of this article, we sketch out this research agenda in the conclusion and provide some hints regarding conflict escalation and the consequences for civilians. In particular the latter should be of interest to the policy community, too. As the proliferation of precision strike technology turns civilians not only into reachable but also \u2018logical\u2019 targets (in a liquid warfare strategy), this proliferation and in particular strategies to curb it should receive more attention by policy makers.\nIn the next section, we introduce the typology of solid/liquid warfare and relate it to NSAGs warfare. Then we discuss the two cases, first the Houthis and then Daesh, to analyse the impact of remote warfare technology on the socio-spatial dimension of their warfare. We sum up our findings in the conclusion and sketch out some policy option to curb the proliferation of remote warfare technology to NSAGs, based on the empirical findings of our two cases.\n## Two socio-spatial dimensions of NSAGs\u2019 warfare"

      "question": "How do contemporary civilian protection doctrines and international law frameworks address the evolving nature of hybrid warfare involving high-precision attacks on infrastructure, and what are the documented challenges or failures in enforcement?",
      "question_context": "This question advances understanding of the legal and humanitarian responses to hybrid warfare strategies targeting infrastructure. It is crucial for evaluating whether strategic shifts are producing gaps in international norms or enforcement, and supports the survey\u2019s comprehensive coverage requirement.",
      "answer": "Contemporary civilian protection doctrines and international law frameworks address hybrid warfare involving high-precision attacks on infrastructure primarily through the application of established International Humanitarian Law (IHL) principles, notably the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols. These frameworks emphasize legal criteria to determine when an armed conflict exists, which activates IHL protections such as the obligation to distinguish between civilians and combatants, the principle of proportionality, and the duty to take all feasible precautions to minimize civilian harm[1]. Critical infrastructure\u2014including medical facilities, vital resources such as water and food, and other civilian objects\u2014receives special protection under IHL unless they qualify as military objectives; attacking them requires careful assessment to prevent excessive incidental damage and avoid reverberating effects on civilian life[2].\n\nHybrid warfare\u2019s evolving nature, which integrates kinetic attacks with cyber operations, disinformation, and proxy utilization, complicates the legal landscape by blurring distinctions between peace and armed conflict and by exploiting ambiguities in conflict classification and attribution[1][3]. Cyberattacks pose particular challenges to civilian protection as their effects can be widespread and indirect, causing harm that is difficult to foresee or measure ex ante, thereby complicating proportionality assessments and the feasibility of precautions[2]. The inherently dual-use nature of cyber infrastructure and the interconnectedness of systems lead to spillover effects that may inadvertently impact civilians despite targeting ostensibly lawful military objectives. Additionally, determining direct participation in hostilities is more complex in cyberspace, raising accountability issues and legal uncertainty regarding state responsibility for cyber combatants operating within their territories[2].\n\nLegal doctrines are further strained by the deliberate reinterpretation or narrowing of key IHL terms by some states, which broaden the definitions of \u201cmilitary objective\u201d and restrict the classification of civilians, thereby permitting greater civilian harm under a more expansive understanding of military advantage and a weakened application of the precautions principle[4]. The prospective deployment of autonomous weapon systems raises further concern as such technologies might operate with minimal human control, potentially exacerbating civilian casualties[4].\n\nEnforcement of international law in the context of hybrid warfare has encountered significant difficulties. Hybrid threats, particularly involving non-state actors supported covertly by states, complicate the classification of conflicts as international or non-international armed conflicts, which affects the applicability of IHL and the legal options available to the defending state. Denial and concealment of support for proxies allow aggressors to stay below legal thresholds for armed conflict classification, leaving states often restricted to law enforcement responses insufficient to counter hybrid tactics effectively[3]. Furthermore, the obscured attribution associated with covert operations, cyberattacks, and proxy involvement impedes legal accountability and timely retaliation, as states must substantiate responsibility before invoking armed response rights[5].\n\nThe enforcement of international protections is also challenged by political and strategic concerns about escalation risk, which may delay or constrain responses to hybrid aggression. International law\u2019s complex and sometimes conflicting principles can be exploited to shield illicit actions, such as using the right to self-determination to justify territorial changes or freedom of expression to defend disinformation campaigns[5]. Moreover, international law\u2019s enforcement mechanisms suffer from structural weaknesses, including reliance on state consent, uneven treaty ratification, and limited practical enforcement capabilities, especially regarding victim protection and addressing vulnerable population groups[6].\n\nProposals to address these enforcement gaps include evolving legal frameworks to explicitly cover proxy occupations, ensuring that temporary peace or stabilization agreements do not legitimize unlawful territorial control, and enhancing international institutional monitoring and cooperation sets[3]. However, despite calls for greater legal clarity and international coordination, the challenges posed by hybrid warfare\u2019s complexity and technological advances continue to strain existing laws aiming to protect civilians during armed conflict[7][8].\n\nIn summary, while contemporary civilian protection doctrines and international law provide established principles applicable to hybrid warfare and high-precision infrastructure attacks, their implementation faces significant hurdles due to ambiguous conflict classifications, difficulties in attributing responsibility, complex impacts of cyber operations, and enforcement limitations. These impediments expose gaps in the effective application of international legal norms and highlight an urgent need for legal evolution and strengthened enforcement mechanisms to address modern hybrid threats[4][1][2][3][5][6].",

            "_In an era of rising geopolitical tensions, terms like \u2018hybrid threats,\u2019 \u2018grey zones,\u2019 and \u2018proxy warfare\u2019 are frequently used to describe covert and ambiguous operations, suggesting they blur the lines between peace and armed conflict. From cyberattacks on civilian infrastructure to the damaging of undersea cables, these acts are often labeled as \u2018hybrid warfare,\u2019 raising questions about their legal and political implications._\n_In this post, and drawing from the_[ _ICRC\u2019s 2024 report on contemporary challenges to international humanitarian law (IHL)_](https://www.icrc.org/en/report/2024-icrc-report-ihl-challenges)_, ICRC Legal Advisers Samit D\u2019Cunha, Tristan Ferraro, and Tilman Rodenh\u00e4user clarify how legal criteria \u2013 not political narratives \u2013 determine whether a situation constitutes an armed conflict, highlighting the importance of accurate classification to uphold the protections afforded by IHL._\nIn the last few months, suspicious fires in warehouses and aboard aircraft, the severing of undersea power and Internet cables, GPS jamming, cyber operations against critical civilian infrastructure, and allegations of influence operations and election interference have been depicted as \u2018hybrid warfare\u2019 by both politicians and the media. So-called \u2018hybrid threats\u2019 or \u2018hybrid attacks\u2019, as well as allegations of the use of proxies to project power while attempting to obfuscate attribution and legal as well as political responsibility are a symptom of worrying developments, in particular in Europe. The geopolitical environment today is characterized by increasing/ed tensions among states, a militarized security environment, instability within countries, projection of power through a range of covert and coercive measures, and \u2013 at the global level \u2013 an increasing number of armed conflicts.",
            "While neither \u2018hybrid\u2019 threats or warfare, nor the notion of proxies, are defined in international law, the use of such terms is often accompanied by the suggestion that certain acts are taking place in a \u2018grey zone\u2019. The term \u2018grey zone\u2019, in turn, appears to suggest that the line between armed conflict and peace is blurring, or that the law is unclear or non-existent in certain of these situations. However, while some of these types of operations are old and others are new, international law always applies. And more specifically regarding , determining whether a specific situation amounts to armed conflict remains an assessment of facts based on well-established legal criteria derived from the four Geneva Conventions as well as their Additional Protocols.\n_This post explores when \u2018hybrid attacks\u2019 or \u2018proxy warfare\u2019 might amount to an armed conflict as defined in IHL. It presents an excerpt of the ICRC\u2019s 2024 report on \u2018_[ _International Humanitarian Law and the Challenges of Contemporary Armed Conflict_](https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2024/10/09/championing-ihl-compliance-in-contemporary-armed-conflict-the-2024-icrc-challenges-report/)\n## \u2018Competition\u2019, \u2018hybrid warfare\u2019, and \u2018proxies\u2019 \u2013 tentative definitions of ambiguous concepts\nIn common usage, the term \u2018competition\u2019 is often employed to describe rivalry between states at the political, economic, and military levels.",
            "\u2018Hybrid threats\u2019 or \u2018hybrid warfare\u2019 are terms commonly used to describe the employment of a combination of different technologies or other means by a state or non-state actor to project power to destabilize adversaries. Acts described as \u2018hybrid\u2019 include military and non-military acts, as well as operations that are covert or overt, kinetic or non-kinetic (for example, disinformation or cyber operations), lethal or non-lethal. The term may refer to operations affecting a state\u2019s military, its government, or its civilian population or infrastructure, and is used to describe operations often conducted by a combination of state and non-state actors.\n\u2018Proxy warfare\u2019 is a term used to refer to armed hostilities involving entities (both state and non-state actors) that other states or non-state actors may support directly or indirectly \u2013 politically, materially, financially, militarily or otherwise \u2013 in line with their own strategic interests against another state or non-state actor.\nThe definition of what is an armed conflict to which IHL applies has not changed. States and other actors must assess each situation of armed violence from a legal perspective to determine whether their operations constitute an armed conflict or form part of a pre-existing one. For example, relying on widely established , the ICRC has assessed that in 2024 there are more than 120 armed conflicts around the world, involving more than 60 different states and 120 non-state armed groups as parties to those conflicts.\nThe significance of the determination whether a situation amounts to an armed conflict is first and foremost legal. While parties involved may or may not consider themselves belligerents for a variety of reasons, as a matter of law they have become parties to an armed conflict and therefore must comply with IHL."

            "In any case, those International Human Rights treaties know absolute and non-derogable rights, including the right to life and the prohibition of torture.\n##  The protection of particular sectors: the notion of critical infrastructure\nAs outlined in the section \"Impact and Harm \" of this platform, cyberattacks and operations during the armed conflict have impacted most sectors of economic activity , including infrastructures or services essential to the survival of the civilian population. The most impacted sectors to date include Energy, Financial, ICT, Media, Public Administration and Transportation. Such attacks may limit or prevent the civilian population from heat, water or electricity. Other sectors have been targeted including the Health and Agriculture sectors.\n, besides general protection offered to civilian objects and civilians, some infrastructures benefit from a specific protection and are thus not targetable unless under specific circumstances. Those infrastructures include medical facilities, objects indispensable to the survival of the population (including foodstuffs, water installations or livestock), works and installations containing dangerous forces (including nuclear power plants), and also, cultural objects and places of worship and the natural environment (see below for more details). In any case, even if the situation would allow targeting one of those objects, rules on conduct of hostilities apply to minimize harm.Some difficulties arise when it comes to the applicability of IHL, notably regarding the geographical scope (please refer to the section \"international normative framework and the applicability of International Humanitarian Law\").",
            "During armed conflict harm to civilians must be avoided to the greatest extent possible. With the use of cyber operations, the challenge is that it may be extremely difficult to assess potential harm to civilians and hence to do the calculation as to whether the harm caused to civilians is proportionate or excessive to the military objective. This is because of the interconnected nature of infrastructure, the inherently dual nature of infrastructure (which is targetable if falling under the definition of a military objective under IHL), and the difficulty to assess the impact and unintended consequences of attacks using cyber tools.\nThis interconnected nature of cyberspace also leads to another challenge: the spillover effects as a result of cyberattacks. These can be intended or unintended consequences of actions, but either way they can impact upon protected people. Whether it is an internet shutdown or an attack against a hospital, the civilian population is at risk. Individuals can be impacted by consequences of a cyberattack even if they are not directly targeted.\nIn IHL, the notion of harm is related to the notion of foreseeability. When preparing or launching the attack there must always be an assessment ex ante of the potential harm it could cause according to the information available at the time. To assess the final harm from the attack, one cannot only refer to the IHL notion of foreseeable harm and damage: it is important to assess the consequences of the attack on the civilian population, whether or not those operations were lawful under IHL. The notion of harm raises a lot of questions: what does harm and de minimis damage mean? Is there a threshold of damage required to reach the notion of harm? What kind of damage falls under this notion? Can psychological harm be considered? And so on.",
            "must be taken to protect civilians and civilian objects against the effects of cyberattacks. In cyberspace difficulties to take all feasible precautions may arise where there is dual-use of technology or cyber infrastructure for military and civilian purposes or the use of cyber means in an attack reverberates and affects various interconnected systems.\nCivilians and civilian objects are protected under IHL unless they turn into military objectives (Article 52(2) of AP I for civilian objects, Article 51(3) for civilians). Indeed, civilians are protected \"_unless and for such time as theytake a direct part in hostilities._\" According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 2009 Interpretative Guidance on Direct Participation in Hostilities, \"Persons take a direct part in hostilities when they commit acts aimed at supporting one party to the conflict by directly causing harm to another party, either by directly inflicting death, injury or destruction, or by directly harming the enemy\u2019s military operations or capabilities.\" Three criteria are thus required: the belligerent nexus, a minimum threshold of harm and a direct causation between the act and the harm.\nDirect participation in hostilities is particularly difficult to determine in cyberspace considering the relatively easy access to cyber capabilities, including from anywhere in the world. Civilians may lose the legal protections afforded to them if they directly participate in the hostilities by engaging in cyberattacks. This makes accountability for actions committed extremely complex, and raises questions within the context of international law, i.e., what due diligence obligations do states not party to the conflict have to cover the activity of cyber combatants operating from their territory?"

            "With hybrid threats, a hostile actor can exploit the legal uncertainty surrounding conflict classification to restrict legally viable options available to the defending State. When the threat involves the conduct of non-State actors, such as maritime militia and terrorist organizations, the existence of an international armed conflict is not obvious. This is because, as the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) established in the case, their conduct does not trigger an international armed conflict unless the State exercises over the group, \u201cnot only by equipping and financing the group, but also by coordinating or helping in the general planning of its military activity\u201d (para. 131). The State employing hybrid threats can deny the international character of the confrontation by deliberately concealing the nature and level of assistance it provides for a group of individuals as they mount a hostile campaign against the foreign target. Conflicting of Israel\u2019s confrontation with Iran illustrate this challenge.",
            "The defending State may pursue another option by characterizing the situation as a non-international armed conflict under common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions. However, the ICTY in and subsequent rulings by international courts and tribunals have determined that this classification is only available when non-State actors engage in \u201cprotracted armed violence\u201d with some degree of organization. Thus, if a hostile actor deliberately repeats isolated and sporadic acts of violence, hybrid threats could stay below the requisite threshold of intensity. In such a situation, the defending State will have no choice but to limit itself to law enforcement action to which various restrictions apply under or, in the maritime context, under of the Law of the Sea Convention, as from judicial and arbitral decisions (\u00a7 3.11.5). If its domestic law or policy imposes stricter restrictions on the use of force in law enforcement, the State will find itself more vulnerable to these hybrid threats.\nOn top of these legal threshold issues, political and strategic concerns about the risk of conflict escalation may impede the defending State\u2019s ability to respond to hybrid threats in a timely and effective manner. Modern technology enables self-organized militia to engage in hostilities at various levels of intensity in different domains, such as and . These hybrid threats put law-compliant countries on the back foot as their response options are regulated within existing legal frameworks that are not flexible enough to allow for escalating the mode of operation as appropriate to the level and type of hostilities they encounter.",
            "My contribution to the latest volume on hybrid threats and grey zone conflicts is an attempt to decipher the mechanism of these threats from a legal perspective. But understanding the causes of the problem is only the first step to fixing it. Merely advocating for compliance with international law or imposing sanctions does not help address the root causes of the problem. International law as a political project has suffered setbacks over the last decade. It is likely to decline further if these structural problems continue to pose challenges to the rules-based international order.\n_is a Professor of Law in the Department of Law at the United States Military Academy._\nPhoto credit: BelTA News Agency"

            "The protective effect of the law is also being undermined by the way some states are interpreting its core concepts and utilizing its more indeterminate provisions. These interpretations broaden the notion of who or what constitutes a lawful target by expanding and narrowing the definitions of \u2018military objective\u2019 and \u2018civilian\u2019, respectively. They make civilian casualties more acceptable through interpretations of the proportionality principle that define \u2018military advantage\u2019 with increasing generosity while simultaneously excluding long-term, reverberating effects from the notion of \u2018incidental harm\u2019. And they hollow out the precautions principle by either directly challenging the obligation to take \u2018all feasible\u2019 precautions to prevent civilian casualties or by treating it more as a policy option than a legal obligation.\nThe deployment of new technologies of warfare risks amplifying these dangerous tendencies. If algorithms are trained in overly permissive targeting rules, the result will be death and destruction among civilians at greater speed and on a larger scale. In extreme cases, and unless new legal limits are agreed, autonomous weapon systems will use force with little restraint, taking life-and-death decisions without human control. Moreover, digital means can be used to cause large-scale damage and disruption of civilian life and essential services in societies where digitalization is under way. Asserting that these means are unregulated, or interpreting applicable IHL rules in a way that undermines IHL's protective function in a digitalizing world, will bring into existence a new dimension of chaos and harm."

            "Similarly, ambiguous ways represent revisionist pathways that, under prevailing norms, issue no clear warrant for military retaliation. One such path involves escaping attribution: If an action cannot be reliably attributed to a specific actor, defenders lack legal standing to retaliate (especially with force). Covert actions, cyberattacks, and proxy groups each promote such obfuscation with varying degrees of success, demanding continuous efforts to bolster attribution capabilities via intelligence and technological innovation. Another form involves normative shielding: International legal principles often conflict with each other, which enables aggressors to take advantage of those inconsistencies by using one valued principle to shield actions that violate another. For example, the principle of self-determination is often invoked to justify territorial changes (even where externally incited), and the concept of freedom of speech complicates efforts to mitigate disinformation (even in the context of election interference). Unlike wars of aggression, then, \u201cgray zone campaigns create a vague, ambiguous environment for legal standards and judgment.\u201d Moreover, muting opposition to an ambiguous aggression raises the likelihood that any armed response would spark public demand for the aggressor to react in kind (painting itself as the victim), which heightens the risk of escalating conflict.",
            "How can international law help deter gray zone aggression? States have used international law to limit the practice of war for well over a century, developing robust norms including self-defense, military necessity, proportionality, and discrimination between combatants and noncombatants. Yet countless recent episodes have demonstrated that policies short of war can also threaten international security. Consider Belarus facilitating illegal migration into the European Union, China employing commercial fishing vessels to disrupt neighboring states\u2019 activities in the South China Sea, or Russia interfering with US elections by spreading disinformation. Such gray zone activities lack the potential destructiveness of war and hence have traditionally attracted less scholarly attention, but they notably appeal to revisionists who would prefer to avoid war themselves (whether due to nuclear deterrence, economic interdependence, or other reasons). As a result, the practical likelihood of facing gray zone aggression for many countries is significantly higher than their risk of facing military invasion. How can those who seek to deter aggression short of war best shape and wield international law to serve that purpose?",
            "Second, the legal concept of armed conflict facilitates efforts to limit its destructive violence via regulative norms regarding conduct in warfare (). International law demands that all uses of armed force meet the standards of discrimination, military necessity, and proportionality, and it further details protections for noncombatants including civilians, prisoners of war, medical facilities, cultural artifacts, and the environment. These norms, each of which has undergone its own history of contestation, are triggered by decisions to undertake military operations, supervening broader peacetime standards such as human rights law (). In contrast, peacetime modes of international competition such as economic rivalries for market dominance are not subject to the laws of war. Constituting shared expectations of legitimate behavior during armed conflict in this way provides focal points for condemnation by governments, domestic opposition parties, and nongovernmental organizations when those expectations are not met."

They include outbreaks of infectious disease, injuries and deaths for soldiers and civilians, population displacement, and destabilization of essential health resources such as food, water, and sanitation []. Conflict impacts not only direct survival, but the systems that contribute to health and safety. In the past, Geneva Convention guidelines were drafted in order to protect civilian populations. The landscape has drastically changed with the advent of hybrid war. The definition of hybrid warfare is not unanimously accepted but can be seen as warfare involving conventional and non-conventional strategies with blatant disregard for civilian lives []. In this scenario, Geneva Convention guidelines are increasingly ignored or circumvented by the absence of provisions specific to these tactics. The war in Ukraine is the latest example of how hybrid war targeting civilians harms public health. Hybrid warfare brings a new era of health concerns that run the risk of unmitigated escalation. Hybrid war can damage health through use of unconventional weapons, sexual violence, military targeting of healthcare facilities and workers, forced depopulation, and sabotage of essential resources and nutrition sources, which all destabilize civilian populations.",
            "A strategy for addressing hybrid warfare globally and equitably should be on the radar of agencies, politicians, and public health professionals worldwide. Its long-term public health consequences and intentional damage to civilians must be acknowledged and acted upon so they can be effectively redressed by the international community. Politicians and public health officials should advocate for a comprehensive rethinking of previous measures to ensure that guidelines of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions no longer go unanswered. If de-escalation fails, the international community and funding agencies must participate financially and logistically to reconstruct and strengthen systems. Civilian health and right to life must be respected by combatants and the global community. Failure to do so will mean this scenario will be played out with greater frequency globally. The line between combatant and civilian deaths has been blurred. Hybrid war's impact on morbidity and mortality is an avoidable erosion of the public health gains of the previous century.

The principle of non-recognition should extend to proxy-occupied zones, even where formal annexation has not occurred, reinforcing the idea that unlawful control by indirect means cannot yield lawful status. At the same time, structured peace frameworks must explicitly exclude proxies from negotiation or governance roles. Including entities installed or maintained through unlawful force risks legitimizing aggression and undermining the rules-based order.

In Europe, multilateral institutions can help monitor compliance. In frozen conflicts or ceasefire zones, stabilization agreements can prevent the re-escalation of violence while preserving future options for legitimate resolution. In the Indo-Pacific, where legal ambiguity is a strategic weapon, such frameworks may be misinterpreted as recognition. Designed carefully, stabilization frameworks provide a mechanism to hold the line diplomatically while enabling phased reintegration or autonomy without conceding sovereignty."

            ".1 Further, unlike conventional military threats, cyberattacks have become unpredictable, multi-faceted, and long-term, often targeting infrastructure that traditional defense measures cannot address. Furthermore, these threats are not confined to State actors; non-State actors, including private individuals or organizations, can launch cyberattacks or defend against them, often complicating the legal response. Cyberattacks can further complicate the legal landscape by threatening State sovereignty without using kinetic attacks that result in physical damage or destruction. International law recognizes the right to self-governance and prohibits interfering with this aspect of a State\u2019s sovereignty. However, traditional methods of interference with self-governance involve kinetic uses of force, differing from cyberattacks which involve non-kinetic means of disrupting a State\u2019s self-governance. Because of technological advances, international law does not fully encapsulate modern cyber warfare. An international panel of experts considered the applicability of existing international law to cyberspace, but their work is not a binding authority and thus does not define cyber operations or principles with legal enforceability. This raises a crucial question: how do States respond to cyberattacks, particularly when the victim State is not engaged in traditional armed conflict with the aggressor? The increasing importance of cyber warfare underscores the need for clearer legal frameworks to guide State responses in modern conflicts. This Note will explore the applicability of jus ad bellum and jus ad vim principles to cyber operations, arguing that current international law\u2019s \u201cgrey zones\u201d do not address the unique challenges of cyberwarfare and potential interference with State sovereignty including election systems"

Much of this centers, Sarkin argues, on the failure of outdated and Western-centric international law to focus properly on the rights of victims and the United Nations\u2019 failure to provide protection for survivor populations.\nSarkin finds weaknesses in international human rights law (IHRL), international humanitarian law (IHL), and international criminal law: \u201cInternational law, in general, is weakened\u2014especially when it comes to dealing with conflict and human rights abuses\u2014by issues of state consent, by a system of states ratifying treaties, by having hard and soft law rules that are often not complied with or enforced as well as many others. Also, IHL deals with civilians as a whole and does not deal with a variety of different groups of people, such as those who are the most vulnerable, as IHRL does. This is not to argue that IHRL always does that very well. In fact, there are lots of gaps and problems. Even more problematically there are very few enforcement options, and, if those mechanisms do take up such cases, they are very few and far between. There are a lot of issues that IHL does not cover or does not deal with sufficiently, such as women\u2019s issues, for example\u2026.\u201d (35)"
