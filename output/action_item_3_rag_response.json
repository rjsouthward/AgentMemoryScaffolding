  "answer": "Recent advances in precision neuroscience prominently feature the development and clinical application of sophisticated brain\u2013computer interface (BCI) technologies such as Precision Neuroscience's Layer 7 Cortical Interface. This device is a high-resolution cortical surface array composed of 1,024 ultra-thin electrodes embedded in a flexible film approximately one-fifth the thickness of a human hair, designed to conform to the brain's surface without penetrating brain tissue, thereby minimizing damage. It enables real-time, micron-scale mapping of the brain\u2019s neuronal activity with unprecedented detail [1][2][3].\n\nPrecision Neuroscience began in 2021 with the vision to create a minimally invasive, high-bandwidth brain interface to aid people with severe paralysis and other neurological impairments. Their Layer 7 technology also underwent FDA clearance in 2025, allowing clinical use for up to 30 days, facilitating intraoperative brain mapping and the collection of high-resolution neural data. This data is intended to train algorithms for complex functions, such as controlling robotic limbs through thought [1][2][3].\n\nClinical research collaborations have expanded, notably with institutions like Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where Layer 7 is being used to record neural activity during craniotomies, advancing understanding of brain function and the neural basis of complex behavior. This research is poised to contribute to precise and individualized treatments for neurological conditions [2].\n\nSignificant progress is illustrated by pilot studies, for example at Penn Medicine, where Layer 7 arrays mapped real-time motor cortex activity during hand gestures. These studies revealed beta wave dynamics\u2014spiral patterns during rest that suppressed during movement and exhibited complex returns post-movement\u2014offering new insights into motor control. Such findings are essential for improving motor decoding algorithms for BCIs aimed at restoring mobility and independence to patients [3].\n\nBeyond neurotechnology, precision neuroscience also encompasses precision medicine approaches for neurological, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, and schizophrenia. These approaches involve mechanistic patient stratification using biomarkers to tailor therapeutic development and clinical trials, addressing the genetic complexity and heterogeneity of these disorders. Companies like PrecisionLife are advancing this field by integrating deep molecular insights and patient stratification to improve drug discovery, trial design, and personalized treatments [4].\n\nTogether, these advances in high-resolution neural interface technology and genotype-driven precision medicine strategies constitute the forefront of precision neuroscience, improving diagnostic capabilities, therapeutic options, and scientific understanding of the brain [1][4][2][3].",

        "Precision began when our co-founders, neurosurgeon and engineer Ben Rapoport and business builder Michael Mager, joined forces to realize Ben\u2019s lifelong dream of bringing brain\u2013computer interfaces (BCIs) to the medical field. We set out to develop something that had never been built before: a high-bandwidth connection to the brain that did not rely on penetrating electrodes, which damage brain tissue. Our vision of a safe, minimally invasive brain\u2013computer interface informed not just the product but also the kind of company we wanted to build: one that would push the boundaries of new technology while remaining laser-focused on human health. \nWe began work in 2021 with a team of four people, three of whom had spent time together at Neuralink. Since then, we\u2019ve developed our core product, a high resolution cortical surface array called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface, and begun manufacturing it in a facility that we own and control. We\u2019ve started testing our device in patients, and are currently expanding our clinical presence. We received our first FDA clearance in 2025, and anticipate having our first commercial product on the market in the near term.\nThe first application for our system will be a goal that BCI researchers have long sought: restoring independence to millions of severely paralyzed people. We are investigating other areas where our system can make a clinical impact in the near future; stroke rehabilitation and refractory depression are at the top of the list. A high-bandwidth brain\u2013computer interface is a foundational technology. It forges a direct connection between human and artificial intelligence. We believe that the implications\u2014for medicine, science, and humanity\u2014are profound, and we feel lucky to be a part of this new era.\n## \"We believe that it\u2019s possible to interface with the brain without damaging the brain.\"\nPrecision launches, raises first capital\nPatent the minimally invasive microslit technique"

But in order to comply with your preferences, we'll have to use just one tiny cookie so that you're not asked to make this choice again.\n## Extending precision medicine into neurological, psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases\nSteve GardnerChief Executive Officer, PrecisionLife \nIn this article, we explain how we're overcoming major challenges in understanding complex disease biology to achieve precision medicine in CNS conditions and how the new era of precision neuroscience is set to benefit patients and our biopharma partners who are investing in the field to develop better treatments for neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases.\nNeurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, which include Alzheimer's disease, ALS, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders, are a leading cause of disability and fatality worldwide, accounting for 17% of global deaths and 10% of disability-adjusted life-years (GBD 2015 Neurological Disorders Collaborator Group, 2017).\n> Achieving precision neuroscience requires a different way of thinking about disease biology...\nThe prevalence of these diseases has grown substantially in recent decades due to an increasing global population, longer life expectancies and increasing morbidity with predisposing risk factors. This now represents one of the most challenging and costly burdens to health and social care systems and societies worldwide.",
        "The development of effective new disease-modifying treatments in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders has been hindered by their inherent genetic complexity, environmental influences and clinical variability. Precision medicine approaches to neurological diseases, such as the use of tofersen to treat patients with specific SOD-1 mutations in ALS, are in their infancy but are fundamental to making meaningful progress and creating effective new therapeutic options in diseases such as ALS, Alzheimer\u2019s and schizophrenia, which still have huge unmet medical need. \nTo find new ways of diagnosing and treating complex diseases we first must understand the mechanisms underpinning their key pathological changes, how these relate to different patient subgroups, and which drugs might be useful in reducing their effects \u2013 this is the basis of precision neuroscience.\nWatch our presentation at the CNS Summit, which was awarded this year's prize.  \n## Guiding Successful CNS Drug Discovery & Development\nThe 20 years since the Human Genome Project has seen transformational advances in the molecular understanding of cancers and rare genetic diseases, leading to genetically informed, personalized selection of therapies and massively improved outcomes for many patients.\nThis is comparatively easier to accomplish in these diseases because they are relatively monogenic. Mutations in a gene may cause structural changes in its protein product, which can lead to a loss of function and consequently to the onset of a disease. While this is an oversimplification, usually all of the patients who share a specific mutation in their tumor can be treated in a similar fashion as they will share this common mechanistic etiology for their disease.",
        "Even stratified, these are still huge markets \u2013 Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias are estimated to directly cost US health systems $345B per year and this will rise by 2050 to $1 trillion. Even 15% of the Alzheimer\u2019s market is worth >$5B/year on a willingness to pay basis.\nAll this is of huge interest when you're putting a new drug on the market and working inside an outcomes-based remuneration model.\nHowever, for those pharmaceutical companies developing CNS treatments without having these patient stratification biomarkers to identify the clinical trial recruits who will benefit from a mechanism, the upper limit of clinical efficacy that they can demonstrate is greatly compromised, and their programs are more likely to fail.\nAs well as condemning $100Ms of R&D investment to be spent in vain and billions of dollars of forecast revenues to be unrealized, this also means that CNS drugs that could in fact have been highly effective for many patients will not make it to market.\nPrecision neuroscience approaches will be essential to overcome the fundamental challenges of such complex, heterogenous and multi-factorial diseases.\n## Accelerating Progress in Precision Neuroscience \nThis precision neuroscience approach is unique to PrecisionLife and proving to be highly effective in even the most complex neurological and neuropsychiatric indications, such as ALS, Alzheimer's, Schizophrenia, and over 45 other chronic diseases. We are using our mechanistic patient stratification biomarkers to support biopharma partners with target discovery, indication selection, clinical trial design, clinical trial rescue, and companion diagnostics, and we are interested in partnering with companies that share our ambition to develop new treatments for people with unmet clinical needs.\nSee how we're driving precision medicine in CNS disorders and view more research from PrecisionLife.\nContact us to find out more about our precision neuroscience research."

        "\u00bb Precision Neuroscience has more positive BCI data\n[Image courtesy of Precision Neuroscience] today announced the presentation of results from a pilot study of its brain-computer interface (BCI) technology.\nResearchers from the lab of Dr. Iahn Cajigas presented results at the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Neuroscience 2024 conference in Chicago. Cajigas serves as a neurosurgeon at Penn Medicine and an assistant professor of neurosurgery and bioengineering at Penn, one of the Precision study sites.\nThe data comes from a study utilizing Precision Neuroscience\u2019s . In March, [Precision Neuroscience said it launched new clinical study sites at Mount Sinai Health System](https://www.massdevice.com/precision-neuroscience-launches-bci-study-sites/) and the University of Pennsylvania. The studies evaluate the Layer 7, a thin-film brain-computer interface technology. Layer 7 features 1,024 tiny electrodes spanning an area of one square centimeter.\nIn Layer 7, Precision Neuroscience embedded the electrodes in a flexible film that conforms to the brain surface. The film comes in at one-fifth the thickness of a human hair. Precision Neuroscience designed it for implantation and removal by neurosurgeons without damaging brain tissue. It maps electrical activity at a high resolution.\n_(Precision Neuroscience is featured on our[2023 list of BCI companies you need to know](https://www.massdevice.com/brain-computer-interface-companies-need-to-know-2023/). You can also check out our lists of BCI companies to know from and .)_\nThe company says it expects its brain implant to enable people with severe neurological conditions, like speech deficits and paralysis, to regain independence, communicate with loved ones and rejoin the workforce.",
        "\u201cThis research could serve as the foundation for life-changing advancements for patients through BCI technology,\u201d said Cajigas. \u201cWith better insights on how the brain controls movement in real-time, we can develop new treatments for patients with paralysis or other impairments. BCIs show great promise to make an incredible impact in patient care.\u201d\n### More about the data on the Precision Neuroscience BCI\nIn the study, investigators placed a Layer 7 Cortical Interface on the motor cortex of a patient undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) for essential tremor.\nAs the patient performed hand gestures, special high-resolution sensors simultaneously captured hand movements. While this took place, the Layer 7 array monitored neural activity in real time. The device provided a first-ever view of the spatiotemporale volution of beta oscillatory behaviors in the motor cortex during common hand gestures.\nAccording to Precision Neuroscience, the study revealed that, while beta waves formed spirals during rest and propagated in one direction (likely representing resting-state neural dynamics), they suppressed during active movement, and returned in a complex pattern after the conclusion of movement.\nThese dynamics could reflect the phasic recruitment of specialized regions within the motor cortex during planning and execution of movement. The company says this offers a new understanding of how the brain controls movement. In turn, this could lead to more precise motor decoding for BCIs, Precision Neuroscience says.\n\u201cWe are building technology to help people with devastating neurological conditions reconnect with the world around them. By collecting as much information as possible about neural activity, we\u2019re making it computable for BCIs to achieve the most exciting functions, like controlling a robotic limb with just a thought,\u201d said Dr. Ben Rapoport, co-founder and chief science officer of Precision Neuroscience."
