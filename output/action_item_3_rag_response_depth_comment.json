  "quality_comment": "\n \"url\": \"https://www.insideprecisionmedicine.com/topics/patient-care/stanford-researchers-identify-six-subtypes-of-depression-using-imaging-technology-and-machine-learning/\"\n This is a low-quality blog source that summarizes Dr. Williams' research (who the question is primarily inspired after). \n \"url\": \"https://www.techexplorist.com/new-category-depression-found-affects-about-quarter-patients/62996/\"\n This is essentially a copy of the above source but by a different news outlet, and is similarly low-quality.\n\"url\": \"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10273022/\"\nThis is the recent research which provided new insights into the biotypes involved in MDD by Dr. Williams, which is a high-quality primary source. \n",
  "relevance_comment": "\nEach document is certainly relevant, as it has content pertaining to Dr Williams' recent research on the biotypes involved in MDD. However, the ranking is incorrect as the third document provides the most essential knowledge, and the other two do not neccesarily provide anything new. In an ideal world the research should have included Dr. Williams' 2025 paper as well. \n",
  "comprehensiveness_comment": "\n The response comprehensively summarizes Dr. Williams' 2023 papers regarding how the cognitive function 'biotype' impacts MDD, but excludes her more recent research on the more specific brain networks involved (specifically the default mode network). It also hallucinates with some statistics (e.g \"remission was 38% in the biotype group and 50% in others...\") Overall I would characterize the response as non-comprehensive. \n"
