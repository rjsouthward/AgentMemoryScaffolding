  "writeup": "# Executive summary\nThis survey synthesizes observed strategic shifts, tactical and technological innovations, external influences, and projected future implications arising from the Russia\u2013Ukraine war. Key findings: Russia has moved toward decentralized, attritional tactics using small assault groups, extended front pressure, and increasingly sophisticated UAV and missile employment [1][2][3][4][5][6]; Ukraine has adapted with agile counterattacks, extensive use of commercial and purpose-built drones, intelligence fusion, and Western-supplied modern systems that have materially altered battlefield dynamics [7][2][8][4][5][9]. International assistance\u2014both lethal and non-lethal\u2014has materially affected operational choices, sustainment, and strategic balance, while partnerships and adversary lifelines (e.g., China, Iran, North Korea) have shaped the conflict\u2019s resilience and external risk profile [diplomatmagazine.eu][en.wikipedia.org][csis.org]. Innovations pioneered and scaled in this war\u2014mass drone deployment, AI-enabled targeting and autonomy, integrated intelligence, and civilian-technology integration\u2014are likely to reshape force structure, doctrine, and regional security calculations for years to come [10][11][12][13][14][15].\n\n## 1. Evolution of military strategies and operational patterns\n### 1.1 Russian strategy: from large offensives to \"thousand cuts\" and UAV-enabled interdiction\n- Shift to smaller, mobile assault teams: Russia reduced reliance on large-scale costly offensives in favor of small, agile assault groups of four to six soldiers that infiltrate lines, attack supply routes and rear areas, then withdraw to avoid counterattacks [1][3].\n- Attrition through distributed pressure: These tactics, described as a \u201cthousand cuts,\u201d aim to incrementally erode Ukrainian defenses by seizing and fortifying small patches to form salients that threaten logistics and force Ukrainian resource diversion [1][3].\n- Extended-front attrition: Russia leverages continuous pressure along an extended front of nearly 1,250 kilometers to stretch Ukrainian defenses and exploit manpower advantages [1].\n- Swarms and combined-arms fires: Russia integrates swarms of drones, missiles, and artillery barrages to degrade positions and shape effects across depth, including strikes beyond frontline artillery range through UAV-enabled interdiction of logistics and M-I facilities [1][4][6].\n- UAV improvements and operational adaptation: Russian UAV capabilities have evolved to include longer ranges, partial autonomy via AI/ML, thermobaric warheads, \u201csleeper\u201d drones, and combined UAV attack tactics that enhance battlefield air interdiction effects [4][5][6].\n- Hybrid industry and volunteer innovation: Drone development in Russia increasingly incorporates volunteer and startup communities augmenting traditional defense industry production\u2014an adaptation to protracted attritional conflict needs [4][5][6].\n\n### 1.2 Ukrainian strategy: agility, asymmetric effects, and technological integration\n- Defensive-to-counteroffensive operational pattern: Ukraine transitioned from defensive operations to reactive, targeted counteroffensives using mobile, mixed-force units supported by modern Western armor and advanced artillery (e.g., HIMARS), emphasizing surprise raids and occupation of weakly held positions to create buffer zones [7][2][8].\n- Drone-enabled precision and resilience: Ukraine has extensively used drones for reconnaissance, precision strikes (including kamikaze drones), supply delivery, PSYOP/guidance to surrendering soldiers, and air-defense augmentation via interceptor drones that reportedly neutralize a large share of incoming threats [7][2][9].\n- Information and intelligence fusion: Operational decision-making benefits from integrated HUMINT, SIGINT, OSINT, and IMINT streams producing an information advantage and enabling rapid targeting and sustainment decisions [7][2][8].\n- Civilian\u2013military innovation loops: Ukraine\u2019s civilian tech volunteers and startups have rapidly adapted commercial off\u2011the\u2011shelf drones and software, accelerating innovation cycles supported by Western aid to produce cost-effective battlefield capabilities [7][4][5].\n\n### 1.3 Common pattern: decentralization, technology, and attrition\n- Shift away from classic blitzkrieg to protracted, decentralized attrition characterized by distributed small-unit operations enabled by unmanned systems, EW, and intelligence fusion on both sides [1][3][4][6].\n\n## 2. Tactical and technological innovations\n### 2.1 Drone ecosystem: types, roles, and operational employment\n- Diverse drone roles: Both sides deploy a wide spectrum\u2014micro-UAVs for close reconnaissance, kamikaze loitering munitions for precision strikes, long-range attack drones for deep interdiction, and unmanned surface vessels for maritime operations\u2014creating multi-domain unmanned pressure [10][16][11].\n- Combined UAV attack tactics: Coordinated drone packages (e.g., swarms, multi-type combinations) produce air-interdiction-like battlefield effects, allowing strikes on logistics and production nodes beyond conventional artillery reach [4][10][11].\n- Dedicated drone units: The conflict spawned specialized formations (e.g., Ukraine\u2019s \u201cArmy of Drones\u201d and Russian UAV regiments), marking drones\u2019 transition from auxiliary assets to independent force elements with command, logistics, and sustainment needs [11][10].\n\n### 2.2 AI, autonomy, and software-enabled targeting\n- Rapid integration of AI-enabled software: Ukraine\u2019s use of AI-supported targeting, satellite-enabled communications, and overhead imagery has accelerated tactical decision cycles and fire coordination [10][17].\n- Autonomy and adaptation: Both sides have pushed for partial autonomy in UAVs (AI/ML) and rapid hardware/software iterations to survive in contested EW environments and countermeasures [4][10][18].\n\n### 2.3 Countermeasures and the anti-drone race\n- Electronic warfare and air defenses: Dense EW and layered air defenses create complex interactions\u2014UAVs evolve to resist EW while defenders seek kinetic and non-EW solutions such as interceptor drones and close-range air defenses [15][11].\n- Need for kinetic anti-drone systems: The expansion of combined UAV tactics underscores a critical need for anti-drone measures not solely reliant on EW, particularly to secure rear areas and logistics hubs [19][15].\n\n### 2.4 Civilian-technology contributions and industrial adaptation\n- Commercial off-the-shelf adaptation: Both sides\u2014especially Ukraine\u2014leverage commercially available drones and civilian software, enabling low-cost mass deployment and rapid capability iterations supported by volunteer tech communities [7][4][5][12].\n- Private sector and space/cyber assets: Cloud services, commercial satellites (e.g., Starlink), and private targeting software have become decisive enablers for connectivity, command, and precision fires in modern territorial defense [diplomatmagazine.eu][12][13].\n\n## 3. International actors, external assistance, and their operational effects\n### 3.1 Western assistance to Ukraine: mat\u00e9riel, intelligence, and sustainment\n- Scale and composition: Western countries (notably the US, UK, EU/NATO members) have provided substantial military assistance\u2014reported at roughly US $174 billion in direct military assistance by early 2025\u2014ranging from Soviet-era stocks to advanced systems such as HIMARS, Leopard 2 tanks, Patriot air defense, and F-16 preparations[diplomatmagazine.eu][en.wikipedia.org].\n- Intelligence and targeting enablement: US, UK, and NATO intelligence support, combined with commercial satellite services (e.g., Starlink), private targeting software, and fire-coordination tools, have materially enhanced Ukraine\u2019s real-time situational awareness and strike effectiveness[diplomatmagazine.eu][ausa.org].\n- Logistical corridors and regional facilitation: Neighboring states (Poland, Romania, Slovakia) provided critical transit and supply corridors for arms, fuel, and humanitarian aid, reinforcing Ukraine\u2019s operational sustainability[diplomatmagazine.eu].\n- Training and integration: Multiannual, coordinated Western programs from 2023\u20132025 expanded training, interoperability, and planning via NATO/EU frameworks, increasing Ukraine\u2019s ability to employ complex Western systems[diplomatmagazine.eu].\n\n### 3.2 External support to Russia and strategic lifelines\n- Economic lifelines: China supplied a significant share of Russia\u2019s energy export market (about 35% of oil and gas export revenue in 2024), helping Russia mitigate sanction impacts and sustain war financing[en.wikipedia.org][dgap.org].\n- Foreign military materiel and personnel: Iran supplied hundreds of Shahed drones to Russia, augmenting Moscow\u2019s operational UAV capacity[en.wikipedia.org]; North Korea reportedly contributed manpower and weaponry to alleviate Russian manpower shortfalls[csis.org].\n- Strategic consequences: These external contributions have allowed Russia to sustain and adapt its campaign despite Western sanctions and arms assistance to Ukraine, while creating asymmetric vulnerabilities tied to partner dependencies[dgap.org][csis.org].\n\n### 3.3 Restraint and escalation dynamics\n- NATO posture and direct involvement: NATO has avoided deploying troops to the conflict zone and refrained from no\u2011fly zone imposition to limit direct escalation risks, while providing material and intelligence support to Ukraine[en.wikipedia.org].\n- Escalation risks from third-party involvement: Potential direct lethal support from states like China to Russia or deeper NATO engagement would materially change the conflict dynamics and international alignments[rand.org][specialeurasia.com].\n\n## 4. Projected future military implications\n### 4.1 For Russia\n- Sustained pressure via improved UAVs and missiles: Russia\u2019s integration of combined UAV attacks and continued missile production is likely to sustain pressure on Ukrainian defenses and generate interdiction effects similar to battlefield air interdiction unless countered by effective anti-drone and kinetic defenses[19][15][10][18].\n- Rapid iterative adaptation: Russian capacity to modify drone designs and tactics within days to evade jamming and EW poses a persistent operational challenge that requires continual defensive innovation[10][18].\n\n### 4.2 For Ukraine\n- Institutionalizing unmanned and information-centric warfare: Ukraine\u2019s experience in producing aerial, surface, and electronic unmanned systems, plus integrating AI-enabled targeting and satellite communications, is likely to institutionalize more connected, software-driven force structures and resilience-enhancing civilian\u2013military innovation models[10][16][17].\n- Force-multiplication under resource constraints: Continued Western materiel and software support, combined with domestic innovation, allows Ukraine to achieve disproportionate effects and the ability to strike interior Russian targets, shaping deterrence and defense planning[10][16].\n\n### 4.3 For neighboring regions and Europe\n- Doctrine and procurement shifts: European planners must account for drone proliferation, cyber/space dependencies, and civilian-tech integration in defense investment and doctrine development, prioritizing layered anti-drone measures and robust resilience in communications and space assets[12][13].\n- Diffusion and escalation risks: Battlefield-proven technologies and tactics are likely to diffuse across allied and non\u2011aligned states; Russia-led partners (China, Iran, North Korea) may adopt and export these innovations to other theaters, potentially fueling arms-race dynamics and instability beyond the immediate conflict zone[16][14].\n\n### 4.4 Wider implications for force structure, doctrine, and arms control\n- Drones as primary combat arms: The emergence of dedicated UAV units and massed unmanned employment indicates future force structures will incorporate unmanned formations with distinct logistics, command, and sustainment chains[11][10].\n- Emphasis on multi-domain integration: Intelligence fusion, EW, cyber, space, and civilian-tech ecosystems will be core to future doctrines; success will hinge on integrating these domains to enable faster targeting, logistics, and resilience[15][10][12].\n- Arms control and export control challenges: Rapid-cycle civilian innovation and volunteer-based adaptations complicate traditional arms-control frameworks and export controls, requiring new policy responses to regulate proliferation while maintaining legitimate civilian use[11][12].\n\n## 5. Operational and logistical consequences\n- Logistics vulnerability and targeting: Both sides have concentrated efforts on targeting supply routes and rear-area logistics\u2014Russian small-group tactics and UAV interdictions specifically aim to disrupt sustainment, forcing Ukraine to defend extended and dispersed supply lines [1][4].\n- Importance of transit corridors: Neighboring countries serving as logistical lifelines have been pivotal to Ukraine\u2019s sustainment and ability to integrate Western materiel into operations[diplomatmagazine.eu].\n- Sustainment limits on advances: Ukrainian counterattacks frequently exploit surprise and mobility but face sustainment challenges when air support, logistics, and munitions stocks are constrained, limiting the ability to consolidate fleeting gains [7][2][8].\n\n## 6. Intelligence, societal resilience, and non-kinetic factors\n- Intelligence fusion as a combat multiplier: The blending of HUMINT, SIGINT, OSINT, and IMINT has materially improved targeting, force protection, and operational tempo\u2014underscoring that intelligence integration is as influential as kinetic systems in modern conflict [7][15].\n- Civilian resilience and technological societies: Ukraine\u2019s civilian tech sector and volunteer networks have bolstered emergency response, information flows, and innovation, demonstrating societal contributions to national defense beyond purely military channels [10][17][12].\n\n## 7. Synthesis: trajectories and decision points for planners\n- Continuous innovation and counter-innovation cycle: Both sides demonstrate rapid-cycle innovation\u2014drones, EW countermeasures, and software-enabled targeting are iteratively advanced and countered, producing a moving technological ground that planners must anticipate [10][11][18].\n- Priorities for defense investment: Effective future defenses will require multi-layered anti-drone systems (including kinetic options), hardened and redundant communications and space assets, integrated intelligence fusion centers, and procurement strategies that leverage civilian-tech partnerships while managing proliferation risks [19][15][12][13].\n- Geopolitical and alliance management: External assistance will remain decisive; alliance coordination, secure supply corridors, and management of third-party support to adversaries will shape operational outcomes and escalate or limit the conflict\u2019s regional spillover[diplomatmagazine.eu][dgap.org][rand.org].",

        "# Ukraine's front line grows bigger as Russia shifts tactics, top commander says\nUkraine's top military commander says the front line in Ukraine created by Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion has expanded to nearly 1,250 kilometers\nSeptember 26, 2025, 3:33 AM\nThe front line on the battlefield in Ukraine has grown in length to nearly 1,250 kilometers (800 miles), stretching Kyiv\u2019s defenses, while Russian forces employ a new tactic of sending swarms of small assault groups to infiltrate Ukrainian lines, Ukraine\u2019s top military commander says.\nThe line of contact has grown by roughly 200 kilometers (120 miles) over the past year, and Ukrainian forces are averaging between 160 and 190 combat engagements every day with Russia\u2019s bigger army, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a review of the battlefield situation.\nAt the same time, Russian tactics have switched since the start of the summer from costly large-scale offensives to deploying small assault groups in a new approach that Syrskyi called the \u201cthousand cuts\u201d tactic.\nHis version of events could not be independently verified, and Russian officials made no immediate comment.\nRussian forces have been with sheer weight of numbers and relentless barrages of drones, missiles, artillery and . Though they have slowly pushed Ukrainian defenders back in rural areas, the Russian army has that constitute defensive strongholds.\nU.S. President Donald Trump, whose efforts to bring an end to the war have , said Tuesday that he believed Ukraine could turn the tide and [win back all the territory](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-un-zelenskyy-trump-f28942b3915e40226654548bb3ee7919) it has lost to Russia, equivalent to around 20% of its land.",
        "Syrskyi said Russia is launching large numbers of small assault groups of about four to six soldiers who use the cover of the terrain to penetrate the front line and then strike Ukrainian rear areas, disrupting supply lines and troop rotations. However, those small groups become cut off and are trapped by encircling Ukrainian forces, he said in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\nSyrskyi told reporters that Russian forces are firing roughly twice as many artillery shells as Ukrainian units.\nBut he claimed that a recent Ukrainian push against Russian positions has regained control of 168 square kilometers (65 square miles) of land.\nUkraine\u2019s long-range strike program, meanwhile, has inflicted heavy damage on Russian military and industrial assets in recent weeks, he said.\nUkraine\u2019s newly created Unmanned Systems Forces, which use increasingly sophisticated drones, carried out 85 strikes on targets inside Russia in less than two months \u2014 33 against military sites and 52 on plants that produce weapons, ammunition, engines, rocket fuel and drones, according to Syrskyi.\nHe credited the strikes with inside Russia that is hampering logistics and army supplies.\nWith winter approaching and Russia expected to escalate its attacks on the Ukrainian power grid, Kyiv is enhancing its air-defense system that combines interceptor drones, helicopters, light aircraft and electronic-warfare systems, Syrskyi said.\nThe improved interceptors take down Russian attack drones at least 70% of the time, he said, adding that Ukraine is now testing light, fixed-wing aircraft armed with machine guns as an additional counter-drone measure.\nHatton reported from Lisbon, Portugal.\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of the war in Ukraine at \n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

        "Russia has changed how it fights on the front lines, swapping big offensives for small, quick raids designed to slowly drain Ukraine\u2019s defenses, according to Kyiv\u2019s top commander.\nGen. , Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, that Russian troops now move in teams of just four to six soldiers.\nThese groups slip through Ukrainian lines, attack supply routes, and pull back before Ukrainian forces can strike back. He called the approach a \u201cthousand cuts\u201d strategy \u2014 many small blows meant to wear down an opponent over time.\n\u201cSince the beginning of summer, there has been a change in the enemy\u2019s tactics,\u201d Syrskyi as saying.\n\u201cTheir main task is to penetrate as deeply as possible into our territory, to withdraw, regroup and advance again \u2014 then attack targets deep inside to paralyze our logistics and troop rotations.\u201d\nInstead of gaining large areas, Russia often plants flags on tiny pieces of land to show \u201cprogress.\u201d Syrskyi said these moments are mostly for propaganda value.\nFighting is especially heavy around Dobropillia and Novopavlivka in the Donetsk region, as well as parts of Dnipropetrovsk. The front line now stretches about 1,250 kilometers (777 miles), putting more strain on Ukrainian troops.\n## Pressure Growing in the East\nBefore the update on Moscow\u2019s new strategy, Russia recently claimed it captured Yunakivka, a small village in the Sumy region.\nSources said that Russia gained only about 1 percent of Ukrainian land in the past year, though it still controls roughly one-fifth of the country.\nIn Pokrovsk, Syrskyi said Russian troops advanced about 20 kilometers (12 miles) before being encircled near the Kazennyi Torets river, adding that Ukraine has retaken or cleared roughly 360 square kilometers (139 square miles) in recent weeks.\nUkraine is now reinforcing its air defenses with helicopters, small planes, and new interceptors that Syrskyi said shoot down about 70 percent of incoming drones."

      "excerpts": [
        "The Ukrainian command demonstrated strong adaptability, shifting from territorial defence to counteroffensives (Kharkiv, Kherson \u2013 2022). Although it later faced difficulties in maintaining strategic initiative (the 2023\u20132024 counteroffensive), Ukraine managed to compensate through creativity, societal resilience, and the integration of Western support.\nA significant example of offensive planning was the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk region (August 2024 \u2013 August 2025), involving mixed units estimated at 8,000\u201312,000 troops. The core consisted of the newly created 22nd Assault Corps and of airmobile and mechanized brigades trained in the West, supported by volunteers and territorial units. The forces were equipped with modern armoured vehicles (MRAP, Humvee, Bradley, Leopard 2), made extensive use of drones for reconnaissance and strikes, and employed precision artillery (HIMARS).\nThe tactics focused on surprise and mobility, conducting rapid raids and occupying weakly defended localities, with the objective of creating a buffer zone and sending a strong political message. However, the lack of air support and logistical difficulties limited the sustainability of the gains, as Russia gradually recaptured most of the territory.\nThe main lesson is that demonstrative operations, even if tactically successful, cannot substitute for a coherent and sustainable territorial reconquest strategy \u2014 but they can have a disproportionate psychological and propaganda impact.\nc) Lessons on assessing the adversary. A central element of the conflict is the strategic assessment error. The Kremlin overestimated its own military capacity and underestimated the Ukrainians\u2019 will to resist. Western intelligence services correctly anticipated the invasion, yet even they underestimated Ukraine\u2019s long-term resilience.",
        "The key lesson: military planning must be based not only on technical or numerical superiority, but also on harder-to-quantify factors \u2014 troop morale, societal mobilization, political legitimacy, and international support.\n. As the war turned into a conflict of attrition, both sides recalibrated their strategies:\n  * Russia shifted from rapid offensive operations to positional warfare, relying on fortified lines and the attrition of the adversary;\n  * Ukraine sought to maintain initiative through precision strikes on Russian logistics and attempts to break the front, but resource constraints reduced its effectiveness.",
        "Time thus became a strategic weapon: each additional month allowed Ukraine to receive military and financial support from the West, while bringing growing costs to Russia. Yet Russia continues its military pressure, betting on the difference in human and material resources between the two countries, as well as on the possible erosion of international support for Ukraine.\n. The strategy and military planning in the Russia\u2013Ukraine war show that success on the battlefield depends not only on technology and numbers, but also on accurate anticipation, adaptability, and societal resilience. The Russian blitzkrieg failed, while the Ukrainian defence succeeded through flexibility and the integration of Western support.\nany strategy must include alternative scenarios and a realistic long-term projection.\n### 2. Intelligence and information superiority\na) The fusion of intelligence sources. One of the most striking aspects of the Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict is the decisive role of intelligence fusion: HUMINT, SIGINT, OSINT, and IMINT.\n  * remained indispensable for understanding the adversary\u2019s intentions and identifying internal vulnerabilities.\n  * and provided a continuous picture of Russian troop movements and logistics.\n  * gained unprecedented importance, as data from commercial or public sources (social networks, publicly available satellite imagery) contributed to monitoring the battlefield."

        "#  Lessons from the Ukraine Conflict: Modern Warfare in the Age of Autonomy, Information, and Resilience\nThe Russia-Ukraine war has emerged as a watershed moment in modern military history, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of contemporary warfare. This white paper analyzes five transformative domains that have defined this conflict: autonomous systems, information operations, electronic warfare, contested logistics, and evolving air defense strategies. By examining the practical applications and lessons learned from this ongoing conflict, this paper provides military planners, defense policymakers, and security professionals with actionable insights for adapting force structures, doctrines, and capabilities to meet the challenges of future warfare. The conflict serves as both warning and blueprint\u2014demonstrating how technological innovation, organizational adaptability, and strategic resilience have become the defining characteristics of military effectiveness in the twenty-first century. \nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 marked a pivotal moment in modern military history, opening new avenues for studying the evolving nature of warfare. What Russian leadership initially anticipated would be a swift campaign has instead developed into a protracted conflict, transforming the battlefield into a real-world laboratory for testing new military technologies, doctrines, and operational adaptations.\nAmong the most significant developments observed in Ukraine has been the transformative role of autonomous systems, particularly unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These emerging technologies are revolutionizing battlefield dynamics, extending operational reach while minimizing risks to human forces and challenging traditional force structures. Simultaneously, the conflict has elevated the importance of information operations, electronic warfare, contested logistics, and innovative air defense strategies in shaping the military landscape of future conflicts."

        "Ukraine has also pioneered the use of drones and accompanying software to perform surveillance tasks mapping out the battlefield and providing real-time situational awareness of enemy deployments. This reconnaissance capability is not new in itself, but has undergone significant upgrades in recent years. Accurate and up-to-date information allows commanders to make informed decisions quickly, improving the effectiveness of military operations.\nBeyond the battlefield, Ukraine has also transformed international understanding of drone warfare at sea. Since 2022, Ukrainian naval drones have succeeded in sinking or damaging around one-third of Russia\u2019s entire Black Sea Fleet, forcing the remainder of Putin\u2019s warships to retreat from Russian-occupied Crimea to the relative safety of Russia\u2019s own Black Sea ports. Most recently, Ukraine to have used naval drones to shoot down two Russian warplanes over the Black Sea. \nIn addition to strike and surveillance functions, Ukraine has also employed drones in . The Ukrainian army uses both aerial and ground-based unmanned systems to deliver ammunition, food, medicine, and other supplies to troops operating in dangerous or inaccessible areas, thereby reducing the need to expose personnel to hostile environments. Drone-based solutions can also potentially facilitate the when manned rescue is deemed to be too risky.\nOne of the most Ukrainian uses of drones on the battlefield has been to help take surrendering Russian soldiers prisoner. This method reduces the need for physical engagement with enemy troops and therefore limits the risks to the Ukrainian side. Drones are used to give instructions using printed messages or via loudspeakers to guide enemy soldiers and indicate safe directions that will allow them to surrender without coming under fire."

        "or use code AITELLY at checkout to get 4 extra months of Surfshark VPN! Russian tactics to breach Ukrainian defenses have shifted away from massive armored offensives toward more discreet and calculated infiltration operations. Instead of deploying large columns of tanks or mechanized units, which have often been blunted by Ukrainian defensive fortifications and constant drone surveillance, Russian forces increasingly rely on small, dismounted infantry groups. These units specialize in slipping through less fortified or poorly guarded sections of the frontline, sometimes referred to as \u201ctotal infiltration\u201d operations, allowing them to bypass strongpoints and penetrate deep into Ukrainian-held territory. Once a gap is found, these small teams move quietly through it, aiming to outflank fixed defenses rather than fight head-on. They often seize patches of ground, fortify them, and then call for reinforcements to consolidate their foothold. Some of these infiltration units\u2014often create Chaos or reconnaissance teams\u2014push as far as 10 to 17 kilometers which is about 10 miles behind Ukrainian positions, creating narrow salients that put critical transport links and logistics hubs at risk. This method enables the Russians to threaten supply lines and force Ukrainian commanders to divert resources to plug these breaches. The approach benefits from Russia\u2019s manpower advantage. By applying pressure simultaneously at multiple points along the front, they overstretch an already undermanned Ukrainian defense, forcing it to cover more ground than it can effectively protect. Drones remain a key part of this strategy, not just for spotting targets but for guiding artillery and airstrikes, though the real focus is on exploiting disorganization and catching understaffed Ukrainian units off guard. The assaults tend to be small-scale and near-constant, chipping away at defenses over time and steadily creating openings for deeper advances"

        "Russians, of course, were developing different types of UAV ISR platforms, so drones for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. But again, this was a rather slow development. And in fact, the year 2022 was supposed to be the year when Russians were going to test a lot of those equipment in various military exercises. And then, of course, when Russia invaded Ukraine, a lot of these plans \u2013 a lot of these technologies \u2013 actually turned out to be not necessarily unsuitable for the type of war that resulted in Ukraine, but it was very clear that a very different approach was necessary.\nAnd so, just like in Ukraine, Russians are utilizing and developing similar types of technologies. In fact, Ukraine is a mirror image \u2013 Ukraine war is a mirror image of military development, and so Russians and Ukrainians are trying to copy some of their successful designs and develop countermeasures to them. The key to the war in Ukraine right now when it comes to autonomous, robotic, and unmanned systems is a very quick research, development, testing, and evaluation cycle. It has shrunk from years to now weeks, and at most several months.\nAnother interesting defining feature of Russian military development of these systems is the fact that the development has now sort of migrated and morphed away from some of the defense industry majors to a very rapidly growing volunteer and startup community. So for the first time in its history, Russia actually has a semblance of a private military industry where civil society has stepped up to deliver some of the products and materials that were absent in the Russian military, starting in mid-2022 when it became clear that this war would be stationary, attritional, and possibly long term. Russians are, in fact, working on a lot of systems that were shown in Kate\u2019s presentation, and I\u2019ll get to that in just a few seconds."

        "Following the invasion in February 2022, Putin strategic Russian nuclear forces and threatened the use of nuclear weapons to defend its territory (including Ukrainian territory captured during the invasion). Within this context, Western nations methodically provided Ukraine with more advanced and long-range systems, one system at a time. For example, British missiles were not employed until May 2023, while U.S. were not provided until October 2023. U.S.-made were supplied to Ukraine in August 2024. By some accounts, nuclear war was only avoided by from the U.S. national security advisor and a from President Biden.\nThe Russia-Ukraine War provides a successful model of how incremental military aid can keep warfare at the conventional, nonnuclear level. Incremental escalation\u2014providing support and then pausing to gauge the Russian reaction before providing more advanced support\u2014contributed to the absence of a nuclear detonation in this conflict.\nInnovation is about cycles. The speed at which adversaries complete cycles of gap detection, innovation, production, and testing impacts which side has a competitive advantage. The Russia-Ukraine War is a laboratory of such innovation and adaptation, especially in drones.\nIn the air, Ukraine\u2019s use of delivered precision weapons at scale. Costing several hundred to several thousand dollars each, Ukraine produced aerial drones in 2024, with a goal to triple that total in 2025. These drones provided surveillance and artillery adjustment, delivered kamikaze attacks on personnel and equipment, and even shot down other drones.\nUkraine, a state without a navy, denied sea terrain access to a great power. Unmanned surface vessels like the Magura V5 were a game changer in the Black Sea. Built from , the Magura V5 sank or damaged several Russian . These sea drones, along with Ukrainian-built cruise missiles, contributed to Kyiv\u2019s ability to export its agricultural products after Russia withdrew from the in July 2023.",
        "Russian forces matched Ukraine\u2019s ingenuity on the battlefield. Their ability to adapt to new Ukrainian technology or tactics has improved remarkably since the war began and can now be measured in mere . One example was their introduction of , which circumvented Ukraine\u2019s radio jamming advances while still matching their predecessors\u2019 range and speed. As with most advancements in the war, this innovation was quickly adopted and subsequently by Ukraine. \nDespite rapid advances, the use of unmanned sea and aerial drones today is still an , not a revolution, of warfare. Judged through the lens of , a revolutionary advance would gain and maintain a significant advantage over adversaries over long periods of time. While innovative, the technological advancements gained through iteration provided battlefield advantage measured in days or even hours before the opponent adapted, thus making it evolutionary. \nFuture warfare will feature innovations that adapt as technologies evolve. [Encrypted AI software in drones](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ukraines-future-vision-and-current-capabilities-waging-ai-enabled-autonomous-warfare) allowed Ukraine to maintain a technological advantage, as a simple firmware upgrade could provide enhanced capabilities without the need for new hardware. Gaining advantages without updating hardware speeds the cycles of innovation \nDespite the of drones destroying tanks in Ukraine, Ukrainian military leaders are adamant that tanks remain crucial.\nTanks with infantry do what air power, indirect fires, and drones cannot do alone: seize and hold terrain. This is often the chief objective of land warfare. Ukrainian Army Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Dutko that his soldiers \u201cignore tanks at high risk.\u201d",
        "On the battlefield, a powerful trio of AI-enabled software, satellite communications, and overhead imagery analysis has enabled the Ukrainian military to efficiently target and deliver kinetic fires. Rapid adaptation of data analysis has enabled rapid evolution in battlefield decisions for warfighting and logistics sustainment.\nState, society, industry, and military units can now be connected directly and at speeds and scales previously unimaginable. Ukraine has created data tools to share tactical data from citizens and military units that bypass traditional government hierarchies. These tools visualize , kinetic fires, emergency response, and even the scope of . \nCompanies have used radar imagery and data from commercial satellites to help Ukrainian civilians find evacuation routes and map power grid damage for restoration without dangerous surveys. The Ukrainian application digital identification and passport system has helped displaced Ukrainians cross borders when physical documents are inaccessible. The Ukrainian tech industry recognizes it possesses several key niche capabilities for future warfare and foresees export opportunities in the future.\nThe Russia-Ukraine War previews the future role of AI and data integration in warfare. Militaries gain advantages by creating a common platform for intelligence, operations, logistics, and planning functions; developing user-friendly systems to minimize training load; and granting authority to frontline forces to rapidly evolve tactics.\n### The Centrality of the Space Domain"

        "Equally, the material support that Western allies are providing for Ukraine \u2013 as well as the fact that both warring parties have a hinterland (the Russian territory in the case of Russia; some parts of Ukraine as well as neighbouring partners in the case of Ukraine) that they can use to safely transfer materiel, base key infrastructure, or manufacture and service equipment \u2013 are not circumstances that can be assumed to be present in a future military confrontation in which Europeans might find themselves. \nNevertheless, Europeans can draw some lessons from this conflict. Our analysis shows that several emerging technologies are playing a crucial role in the war. They are changing the context of the fighting, its speed, and they involve new actors. Europeans should take the following four observations into account as they draw on the experiences of the war so far.\n### Lesson 1. Private technology companies are playing an ever more important role in warfare \nPrivate \u2013 and mostly civilian \u2013 technology companies have provided crucial systems and services to Ukrainians and their armed forces throughout the war. The most visible roles for these companies have been in internet connectivity, and in the cloud computing and cyber field. Other companies have provided hardware, such as drones, or software to improve legacy systems.",
        "\u201cThe courage of Ukrainians + technology = the key to Ukraine\u2019s future victory.\u201d Ukraine\u2019s deputy prime minister, Mykhailo Fedorov\nAnalysts have already dubbed it the the and Ukrainian civilians inform their armed forces of Russian advances by logging sightings of military vehicles in apps. Drones populate the skies 24 hours a day, streaming back images of troop movements and attacks. According to Fedorov, cloud services [basically helped Ukraine survive as a state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiJG8UjHb-g).\nThis war is, of course, not all about \u201c new technologies \u2013 as NATO calls them: AI, apps, automated systems, and more. Some of Ukraine\u2019s most urgent demands have been for and Soviet-era air defences are playing crucial roles. \u201c anti-tank obstacles \u2013 something most Europeans associate with the second world war \u2013 are making a reappearance, protecting the rows of trenches that scar the front lines. But the way both sides have put emerging technology to use in this context is revealing. The war in Ukraine employs, in one way or another, most of the technological advances the world has made over the last decades. If Europeans want to be serious about building up their defence capabilities, they need to pay close attention to and learn from Ukraine\u2019s and Russia\u2019s experiences so far. \nThis paper therefore examines the role of drones, cyber warfare, software-defined warfare and AI, and space technologies in the war in Ukraine. It reveals how the conflict has become a testing ground for new military systems. Innovation is happening at high speed. Never before have so many drones been deployed in a military confrontation. Cloud services and cyber defences have provided existential support. Software, often AI-enabled, is used to improve legacy systems. Without support from satellites, Ukraine would not be able to defend its territory."

        "Time thus became a strategic weapon: each additional month allowed Ukraine to receive military and financial support from the West, while bringing growing costs to Russia. Yet Russia continues its military pressure, betting on the difference in human and material resources between the two countries, as well as on the possible erosion of international support for Ukraine.\n. The strategy and military planning in the Russia\u2013Ukraine war show that success on the battlefield depends not only on technology and numbers, but also on accurate anticipation, adaptability, and societal resilience. The Russian blitzkrieg failed, while the Ukrainian defence succeeded through flexibility and the integration of Western support.\nany strategy must include alternative scenarios and a realistic long-term projection.\n### 2. Intelligence and information superiority\na) The fusion of intelligence sources. One of the most striking aspects of the Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict is the decisive role of intelligence fusion: HUMINT, SIGINT, OSINT, and IMINT.\n  * remained indispensable for understanding the adversary\u2019s intentions and identifying internal vulnerabilities.\n  * and provided a continuous picture of Russian troop movements and logistics.\n  * gained unprecedented importance, as data from commercial or public sources (social networks, publicly available satellite imagery) contributed to monitoring the battlefield.",
        "a shortage of ammunition or fuel can halt entire offensives, regardless of numerical or technological superiority.\ne) Drone technology \u2013 transforming modern warfare. One of the most visible and innovative aspects of the Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict has been the large-scale use of drones, which has profoundly changed the way military operations are conducted.\nProliferation and diversification of drones. Both sides have used a wide range of drones \u2014 from adapted commercial micro-UAVs to FPV kamikaze drones, heavy aerial vehicles, and autonomous naval drones. Their low cost, the availability of commercial components, and rapid adaptability enabled industrial-scale production and mass deployment, including in swarms.\nDrones became an integral part of the kill chain: they detect targets, transmit coordinates in real time, and guide artillery or missile strikes. Their combined use with artillery systems has significantly increased the precision and reaction speed on the battlefield.\nThe rise of specialized formations. The escalating use of drones led both armies to create dedicated formations. As early as 2023, Ukraine launched the \u201cArmy of Drones\u201d programme, which resulted in the creation of dedicated drone brigades and battalions with their own training, logistics, and command structures. Russia followed the same trend, forming by 2024 specialised UAV regiments and units within its ground and air forces. This marks the transition of drones from auxiliary means to stand-alone weapons with their own decision chains.\nThe mass use of drones has forced the development of specific countermeasures. Both sides have heavily invested in:\n  * electronic warfare (jamming, spoofing, disruption of command links and GPS/GLONASS signals);\n  * close-range air defence (automatic cannons, optically guided machine guns, programmable ammunition, MANPADS);\n  * improvised physical barriers (metal nets, cages, light armour on vehicles and fixed positions)."

        "Competency matters as much, if not more, than technology. The conflict has underscored the importance of \u201csoft\u201d aspects of military power, such as tactical proficiency, sound operational planning, and coherent strategy. Therefore, military analysts must devise new ways to measure these intangible aspects of military power for forces untested by battle, and future combatants will need to prioritize the development of such aspects to avoid a painful learning curve once conflict begins. \nWhether air superiority can be achieved is critical in shaping the battlefield. Many dilemmas in the Russia-Ukraine war stem from each side\u2019s inability to establish air superiority. Layered air defenses, the effective use of man-portable air-defense systems, and low-cost one-way attack small UASs have constrained traditional air power. Although a similar difficulty in achieving air superiority could arise in a future conflict in the Indo-Pacific region, a potential North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\u2013Russia war would likely see NATO air forces control the skies, altering some of the dynamics that have shaped the battlefield in Ukraine. \n## The Conflict Has Produced Major Shifts in the International System\nThe impact of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has resounded throughout the international system. Although many of the effects have been incremental rather than revolutionary, the resulting shifts in the international system are nonetheless significant and, in some cases, likely to be long-lasting. The research team examined the war\u2019s geopolitical impact by assessing Europe\u2019s, Russia\u2019s, China\u2019s, and India\u2019s reactions and adaptations to the war and changes to the broader international system and norms.",
        "Russia uses a kinetic anti-satellite weapon in low earth orbit against commercial targets that generates massive debris. This development would weaken persistent surveillance capabilities, potentially enhancing the ability for all states to conduct offense operations. This could heighten China\u2019s fears that the international system is unstable and raise expectations for a larger war.\nChina provides lethal military support to Russia. This development could suggest that Beijing perceives the U.S. capacity for sustained conflict as stronger than expected. This development would also challenge international humanitarian law and raise the question of whether China intends to renounce internal norms against military aggression.\nNATO directly intervenes in the Russia-Ukraine war. This development would suggest consensus that materiel and economic support for Ukraine alone cannot achieve regional security goals. This development would also drive an increase in defense production and cooperation and reduce many obstacles to Ukraine\u2019s integration with Europe.\nHow the war ends could influence long-term regional and international effects by shaping views on Russia\u2019s ambitions, European security concerns, and Ukraine\u2019s prospects of integration into Europe. The research team assessed the effects of three possible scenarios on this analysis and its findings.\nRussia succeeds in its initial objective for the invasion by militarily imposing a change of government in Kyiv. A clear Russian victory in the war would call into question whether non-Western powers might be able to reshape aspects of the international system. A Russian victory would also likely intensify European DIB reform efforts and drive regional increases in defense spending."

        "The security-insecurity paradox in a geopolitical struggle between Russia and its ex-territory; Ukraine along with the politics of the influences between great powers has made the Russian invasion a reality. Russian intervention in its periphery in February 2022 has sent shockwaves to the European Union and NATO members, and posed various challenges to the Eurasian states. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a protracted one, but this new phase is more complex and multi-layered. Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol in 2014, and support to the militant separatists in Donbas, undermined Ukrainian sovereignty. A series of border skirmishes occurred during 2014-2021, which led to thousands of people dead and injured.[1] The tension converted into a humanitarian crisis with millions of refugees and collateral damages after the 2022 war. This recent situation can be termed as a geopolitical warfare, which is based on the politics of security to assert political advantages in the desired geopolitical sphere of influence. In this paper, an effort has been made to examine the structural, bilateral, and regional issues that have led Russia to engage in a risky war. It hypothesise that this war cannot be recognized only as a bilateral war between Russia and Ukraine based on the old issues, rather it is the result of new developments in the shape of Ukraine\u2019s pursuit for a new identity and affinity with West, its bid for NATO membership and as a client of US and EU against Russia in the great power rivalry. The theoretical lens of Neo-Realism and the security dilemma best explains the causes of the war between the two. Finally, this study also endeavours to trace some important implications for the Eurasian Region. [1] Conflict-Related Civilian Casualties in Ukraine.

        "The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has emerged as a significant geopolitical tension, with far-reaching implications for global stability and security. This paper intends to study the impact of the war on the worlds and regional economic development and political stability, and achieve some findings that may trigger further policy considerations in mitigating challenges and issues imposed by the war. Through literature reviews and comparison analysis, the findings reveal economic, political, and security consequences of the conflict. The disruption of trade flows, economic sanctions, and uncertainty have impacted both Russia and Ukraine, as well as the wider region and the world. Energy security concerns and shifts in military alliances have added to the complexity of the conflict. The expansion of NATO and increased rivalries between Russia and Western countries have further heightened tensions. Based on the findings, the paper concludes that the Russia-Ukraine conflict poses a significant threat to global economic stability and political security. It emphasizes the need for a multilateral approach to address the conflict and promote peace and stability in the region. Ceasefire agreements, humanitarian assistance, and reconstruction efforts are crucial steps towards long-term peace and development. The paper highlights the importance of prioritizing diplomatic solutions over short-term gains from the conflict. In summary, this paper intends to explore the implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on global stability and security, with findings that underscore the need for international cooperation and concerted efforts to mitigate the consequences of the conflict and foster a peaceful resolution."

        "Emerging technologies have been extensively used in the war in Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine have deployed a range of innovative military technologies, from armed drones and electronic warfare systems to cyberattacks and AI-enabled intelligence gathering. Many experts expected Russia\u2019s larger military and investment in modernizing its forces would give it a technological advantage; however, Ukraine has effectively leveraged emerging technologies to resist and launch counteroffensives. Notwithstanding the tragedy of the situation, the war in Ukraine has given us a new set of datapoints on the role of emerging technologies in warfare. The insights from the role of emerging technologies on the war in Ukraine are not straightforward. On the one hand, this war has been very conventional and exhibited a high degree of with warfare of previous decades (or even centuries). On the other hand, emerging technologies have the character of war by creating new vectors for crisis escalation, new capabilities on the battlefield, and an opportunity for new actors to play a key role in conflict. It is worthwhile to explore many of these technologies in isolation, as a suite of capabilities, and as a wider phenomenon in the war in Ukraine.",
        "To summarize, emerging technologies did not have a noticeable escalatory nor de-escalatory effect during the Ukraine crisis that would make them unique from other military capabilities and applications. Where emerging technologies potentially did have an escalatory effect was to the crisis by giving Russia a false sense of supremacy and shaping perceptions in Moscow about the likelihood of success and relatively low costs of invasion. This argument comes with an inherent humility, as no one can know what Putin\u2019s perceptions were and Kremlin decision-making is notoriously murky. While the tactical impacts might be limited, the strategic impacts of emerging technologies more broadly point to concerning trends for escalation. Nonetheless, there are other trends in the war in Ukraine that should caution against a false sense of complacency about the escalatory potential of emerging technologies, to include potential for wormhole and inadvertent escalation. Three such trends include new actors, new escalation pathways, and new timescales.",
        "We argue that emerging technologies gave Russia a false sense of supremacy in the lead-up to the war in Ukraine and have largely failed to deliver Russia battlefield victories. As a result, Moscow has increased reliance on nuclear weapons and nuclear threats. This reliance could be exacerbated in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine when Russia is conventionally weakened. Therefore, it is not the technologies themselves that increase risks of escalation, but their military contributions that could lead states to initiate or escalate conflicts. The limited role of emerging technologies on the battlefields in Ukraine should not inspire complacency. Instead, these technologies and their military applications provide a preview of ways that emerging technologies could contribute to escalation in the future both before and during conflicts."

        "The third year of the Russian war in Ukraine has brought several surprising developments, including Ukraine\u2019s incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region, the direct involvement of North Korean troops on the battlefield, and a series of long-range strikes on Russia\u2019s strategic targets conducted by Ukraine, at times with the use of autonomous technologies. The scope of this war has clearly exceeded regional dimensions and is evolving into a global confrontation. Over 50 countries have joined , collaborating to coordinate military aid. Nations from are contributing both lethal and non-lethal assistance to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia's military allies include the global power China, along with regional players like North Korea and Iran, whose involvement in the conflict Involvement in this war is not driven solely by ideological reasons. Allied states and private-sector actors are paying close attention to weaponry deployed on the battlefield, tested against a technologically advanced adversary, and then further refined. What could these developments mean for the world? Ukraine\u2019s military and technological innovations and the need for responsible arms control Both parties to the war, Ukraine and Russia, have significantly increased their military production since February 2022. While Ukraine cannot match Russia's weapon production in terms of quantity, it has deliberately prioritized quality. Ukraine's strategic objective is its domestic long-range capabilities and creating conditions for achieving a technological advantage over Russian forces. Ukraine's most significant military assets are unmanned aerial systems, which have [ reshaped the basic outlines of modern warfare.](https://unidir.org/publication/webinar-series-summary-armed-and-dangerous-a-brief-overview-of-uncrewed-aerial-systems-risks-impacts-and-avenues-for-action/) The [main trends in UAV development](https://kse",
        ". Collaboration with Ukrainian engineers and technical staff on producing drones, ammunition, and air defense systems is particularly attractive. Prominent players such as U.S.-based , Germany\u2019s , and Turkey\u2019s have swiftly established offices or drone manufacturing plants in Ukraine. Meanwhile, German Rheinmetall at least four factories in Ukraine to produce artillery shells, military vehicles, gunpowder, and anti-aircraft weapons. This expansion would significantly boost Ukrainian defense production amid ongoing ammunition shortages. However, in the long term, it is difficult to predict how these advanced technologies and direct involvement in the Ukrainian battlefield might be utilized in other conflicts. A notable example is the plan to deploy battle-tested American , initially used in Ukraine, to Taiwan. The Rule of Law in Armed Conflict Online Portal (RULAC), based in Geneva, tracks over . Military producers, motivated by profit, are likely to attract customers seeking battlefield-tested innovations that provide a decisive edge in warfare. Although the full impact of these developments may not be visible by 2025, it is expected that, within a few years, military technologies refined in the Russian-Ukrainian war will begin to emerge in other parts of the world, particularly in areas where Western states are engaged. Deepening military cooperation within the Russia-led alliance: potential for immediate global threats Russia its defense industry to sustain its ongoing military operations, significantly increasing production by introducing additional shifts, expanding production lines at existing facilities, and reopening decommissioned factories. These measures have led to substantial increases in output. At the start of 2023, Russia six Iskander 9M723 ballistic missiles per month, with a stockpile of approximately 50. By early 2024, despite extensive use, its stockpile had grown to nearly 200 Iskander 9M723 ballistic and 9M727 cruise missiles"

Our analysis shows that several emerging technologies are playing a crucial role in the war. They are changing the context of the fighting, its speed, and they involve new actors. Europeans should take the following four observations into account as they draw on the experiences of the war so far.\n### Lesson 1. Private technology companies are playing an ever more important role in warfare \nPrivate \u2013 and mostly civilian \u2013 technology companies have provided crucial systems and services to Ukrainians and their armed forces throughout the war. The most visible roles for these companies have been in internet connectivity, and in the cloud computing and cyber field. Other companies have provided hardware, such as drones, or software to improve legacy systems.",

Drones populate the skies 24 hours a day, streaming back images of troop movements and attacks. According to Fedorov, cloud services [basically helped Ukraine survive as a state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiJG8UjHb-g).\nThis war is, of course, not all about \u201c new technologies \u2013 as NATO calls them: AI, apps, automated systems, and more. Some of Ukraine\u2019s most urgent demands have been for and Soviet-era air defences are playing crucial roles. \u201c anti-tank obstacles \u2013 something most Europeans associate with the second world war \u2013 are making a reappearance, protecting the rows of trenches that scar the front lines. But the way both sides have put emerging technology to use in this context is revealing. The war in Ukraine employs, in one way or another, most of the technological advances the world has made over the last decades. If Europeans want to be serious about building up their defence capabilities, they need to pay close attention to and learn from Ukraine\u2019s and Russia\u2019s experiences so far. \nThis paper therefore examines the role of drones, cyber warfare, software-defined warfare and AI, and space technologies in the war in Ukraine. It reveals how the conflict has become a testing ground for new military systems. Innovation is happening at high speed. Never before have so many drones been deployed in a military confrontation. Cloud services and cyber defences have provided existential support. Software, often AI-enabled, is used to improve legacy systems. Without support from satellites, Ukraine would not be able to defend its territory."

Russian UAV adaptations are likely achieving some effects of battlefield air interdiction (BAI): The use of airpower to strike targets in the near rear of the frontline to impact battlefield operations in the near term.[1] Neither Ukraine nor Russia has been able to conduct BAI using manned aircraft or UAVs due to the density and sophistication of adversary air defenses and electronic warfare (EW) over the past three years, but Russian forces are now achieving partial BAI effects in support of their offensives.[2] Russia\u2019s allies, especially the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), have enabled Russia to develop and scale the production of UAVs that are more resistant to EW interference and capable of operating at longer distances, higher speeds, and in challenging environments. Ukraine and its partners must invest urgently in kinetic anti-drone systems that are not reliant on EW to secure near-rear areas and, ultimately, frontline positions as well."

      "question_context": "Identifying and summarizing key changes, tactics, and operational innovations is foundational to understanding how military approaches have evolved on both sides\u2014this is crucial as a baseline for the entire topic.",
      "answer": "Throughout the course of the Russia-Ukraine war, both sides have exhibited significant shifts in military strategies and introduced innovations that reflect adaptation to evolving battlefield conditions. \n\nOn the Russian side, there has been a notable shift away from large-scale, costly offensives to a strategy involving smaller, more agile assault groups typically composed of four to six soldiers. These groups engage in infiltration operations that penetrate Ukrainian lines, target supply routes, and strike rear areas before withdrawing to avoid counterattacks. This approach, termed the \u201cthousand cuts\u201d tactic, aims to wear down Ukrainian defenses incrementally by seizing and fortifying small patches of territory to create salients that threaten logistics and necessitate Ukrainian resource diversion for defense. Russian tactics have benefited from employing continuous pressure along the extended front line of nearly 1,250 kilometers and using swarms of drones, missiles, and artillery barrages to degrade Ukrainian positions. There is also evidence of improved Russian UAV capabilities featuring enhancements such as longer flight ranges, partial autonomy via AI/machine learning, thermobaric warheads, sleeper drones, and combined UAV attack tactics that facilitate battlefield air interdiction effects \u2014 targeting Ukrainian military-industrial and civilian infrastructure beyond frontline artillery range. Furthermore, Russian drone development has evolved to include emerging volunteer and startup communities supplementing traditional defense industry efforts, reflecting adaptation to the prolonged, attritional nature of the conflict [1][2][3][4][5][6].\n\nUkraine, for its part, has demonstrated significant adaptability, shifting from defensive territorial operations to reactive and targeted counteroffensives using mobile, mixed-force units heavily supported by Western-provided modern armored vehicles and advanced artillery like HIMARS. Ukrainian tactics emphasize surprise, rapid raids, and occupation of weakly defended positions to create buffer zones, although sustainment of gains is often difficult due to logistical and air support constraints. On the technological front, Ukraine has pioneered the comprehensive use of drones not only for reconnaissance and precision strikes \u2014 including launching kamikaze drones for attacking enemy positions \u2014 but also for innovative roles such as delivering supplies, guiding surrendering Russian soldiers, and bolstering air defenses via interceptor drones that reportedly neutralize up to 70% of incoming Russian drones. Ukraine\u2019s Unmanned Systems Forces have executed numerous strikes inside Russian territory against military and industrial targets, thereby disrupting Russian logistics and production capacities. Additionally, Ukraine integrates commercial off-the-shelf drones adapted for battlefield use, leveraging their cost-effectiveness and availability, while benefiting from rapid software and hardware innovation cycles supported by civilian volunteer groups and Western aid. Enhanced intelligence fusion combining HUMINT, SIGINT, OSINT, and IMINT further empowers operational decisions, illustrating Ukraine\u2019s utilization of information superiority and technological innovation as force multipliers [7][2][8][4][5][9].\n\nCollectively, the conflict exhibits a shift from classical blitzkrieg and large-unit maneuvers to protracted attritional warfare involving decentralized, technology-enabled tactics. Russia leverages manpower advantage and increasingly sophisticated UAVs combined with small-unit infiltration to exhaust Ukrainian defenses, while Ukraine counters through agile counterattacks, advanced drone use, and information integration. Both sides\u2019 strategies underscore the critical role of autonomy, unmanned systems, electronic warfare, and intelligence fusion in shaping modern military operations in this war [1][3][4][6].",

            "The Ukrainian command demonstrated strong adaptability, shifting from territorial defence to counteroffensives (Kharkiv, Kherson \u2013 2022). Although it later faced difficulties in maintaining strategic initiative (the 2023\u20132024 counteroffensive), Ukraine managed to compensate through creativity, societal resilience, and the integration of Western support.\nA significant example of offensive planning was the Ukrainian incursion into the Kursk region (August 2024 \u2013 August 2025), involving mixed units estimated at 8,000\u201312,000 troops. The core consisted of the newly created 22nd Assault Corps and of airmobile and mechanized brigades trained in the West, supported by volunteers and territorial units. The forces were equipped with modern armoured vehicles (MRAP, Humvee, Bradley, Leopard 2), made extensive use of drones for reconnaissance and strikes, and employed precision artillery (HIMARS).\nThe tactics focused on surprise and mobility, conducting rapid raids and occupying weakly defended localities, with the objective of creating a buffer zone and sending a strong political message. However, the lack of air support and logistical difficulties limited the sustainability of the gains, as Russia gradually recaptured most of the territory.\nThe main lesson is that demonstrative operations, even if tactically successful, cannot substitute for a coherent and sustainable territorial reconquest strategy \u2014 but they can have a disproportionate psychological and propaganda impact.\nc) Lessons on assessing the adversary. A central element of the conflict is the strategic assessment error. The Kremlin overestimated its own military capacity and underestimated the Ukrainians\u2019 will to resist. Western intelligence services correctly anticipated the invasion, yet even they underestimated Ukraine\u2019s long-term resilience.",
            "The key lesson: military planning must be based not only on technical or numerical superiority, but also on harder-to-quantify factors \u2014 troop morale, societal mobilization, political legitimacy, and international support.\n. As the war turned into a conflict of attrition, both sides recalibrated their strategies:\n  * Russia shifted from rapid offensive operations to positional warfare, relying on fortified lines and the attrition of the adversary;\n  * Ukraine sought to maintain initiative through precision strikes on Russian logistics and attempts to break the front, but resource constraints reduced its effectiveness.",
            "Time thus became a strategic weapon: each additional month allowed Ukraine to receive military and financial support from the West, while bringing growing costs to Russia. Yet Russia continues its military pressure, betting on the difference in human and material resources between the two countries, as well as on the possible erosion of international support for Ukraine.\n. The strategy and military planning in the Russia\u2013Ukraine war show that success on the battlefield depends not only on technology and numbers, but also on accurate anticipation, adaptability, and societal resilience. The Russian blitzkrieg failed, while the Ukrainian defence succeeded through flexibility and the integration of Western support.\nany strategy must include alternative scenarios and a realistic long-term projection.\n### 2. Intelligence and information superiority\na) The fusion of intelligence sources. One of the most striking aspects of the Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict is the decisive role of intelligence fusion: HUMINT, SIGINT, OSINT, and IMINT.\n  * remained indispensable for understanding the adversary\u2019s intentions and identifying internal vulnerabilities.\n  * and provided a continuous picture of Russian troop movements and logistics.\n  * gained unprecedented importance, as data from commercial or public sources (social networks, publicly available satellite imagery) contributed to monitoring the battlefield."

This white paper analyzes five transformative domains that have defined this conflict: autonomous systems, information operations, electronic warfare, contested logistics, and evolving air defense strategies. By examining the practical applications and lessons learned from this ongoing conflict, this paper provides military planners, defense policymakers, and security professionals with actionable insights for adapting force structures, doctrines, and capabilities to meet the challenges of future warfare. The conflict serves as both warning and blueprint\u2014demonstrating how technological innovation, organizational adaptability, and strategic resilience have become the defining characteristics of military effectiveness in the twenty-first century. \nRussia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 marked a pivotal moment in modern military history, opening new avenues for studying the evolving nature of warfare. What Russian leadership initially anticipated would be a swift campaign has instead developed into a protracted conflict, transforming the battlefield into a real-world laboratory for testing new military technologies, doctrines, and operational adaptations.\nAmong the most significant developments observed in Ukraine has been the transformative role of autonomous systems, particularly unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These emerging technologies are revolutionizing battlefield dynamics, extending operational reach while minimizing risks to human forces and challenging traditional force structures. Simultaneously, the conflict has elevated the importance of information operations, electronic warfare, contested logistics, and innovative air defense strategies in shaping the military landscape of future conflicts."

This reconnaissance capability is not new in itself, but has undergone significant upgrades in recent years. Accurate and up-to-date information allows commanders to make informed decisions quickly, improving the effectiveness of military operations.\nBeyond the battlefield, Ukraine has also transformed international understanding of drone warfare at sea. Since 2022, Ukrainian naval drones have succeeded in sinking or damaging around one-third of Russia\u2019s entire Black Sea Fleet, forcing the remainder of Putin\u2019s warships to retreat from Russian-occupied Crimea to the relative safety of Russia\u2019s own Black Sea ports.

The Ukrainian army uses both aerial and ground-based unmanned systems to deliver ammunition, food, medicine, and other supplies to troops operating in dangerous or inaccessible areas, thereby reducing the need to expose personnel to hostile environments. Drone-based solutions can also potentially facilitate the when manned rescue is deemed to be too risky.\nOne of the most Ukrainian uses of drones on the battlefield has been to help take surrendering Russian soldiers prisoner. This method reduces the need for physical engagement with enemy troops and therefore limits the risks to the Ukrainian side. Drones are used to give instructions using printed messages or via loudspeakers to guide enemy soldiers and indicate safe directions that will allow them to surrender without coming under fire."

They had scrawled a message in blue Cyrillic letters on a makeshift white poster and were frantically waving it skyward at the hovering drone: \u201cWe want to surrender.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when the 3rd Brigade recorded a video of something that they believe had never happened before: The first successful assault carried out exclusively by robots.\nCourtesy of the 3rd Assault Brigade"

Russian tactics to breach Ukrainian defenses have shifted away from massive armored offensives toward more discreet and calculated infiltration operations. Instead of deploying large columns of tanks or mechanized units, which have often been blunted by Ukrainian defensive fortifications and constant drone surveillance, Russian forces increasingly rely on small, dismounted infantry groups. These units specialize in slipping through less fortified or poorly guarded sections of the frontline, sometimes referred to as \u201ctotal infiltration\u201d operations, allowing them to bypass strongpoints and penetrate deep into Ukrainian-held territory. Once a gap is found, these small teams move quietly through it, aiming to outflank fixed defenses rather than fight head-on. They often seize patches of ground, fortify them, and then call for reinforcements to consolidate their foothold. Some of these infiltration units\u2014often create Chaos or reconnaissance teams\u2014push as far as 10 to 17 kilometers which is about 10 miles behind Ukrainian positions, creating narrow salients that put critical transport links and logistics hubs at risk. This method enables the Russians to threaten supply lines and force Ukrainian commanders to divert resources to plug these breaches. The approach benefits from Russia\u2019s manpower advantage. By applying pressure simultaneously at multiple points along the front, they overstretch an already undermanned Ukrainian defense, forcing it to cover more ground than it can effectively protect. Drones remain a key part of this strategy, not just for spotting targets but for guiding artillery and airstrikes, though the real focus is on exploiting disorganization and catching understaffed Ukrainian units off guard. The assaults tend to be small-scale and near-constant, chipping away at defenses over time and steadily creating openings for deeper advances"

            "Russians, of course, were developing different types of UAV ISR platforms, so drones for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. But again, this was a rather slow development. And in fact, the year 2022 was supposed to be the year when Russians were going to test a lot of those equipment in various military exercises. And then, of course, when Russia invaded Ukraine, a lot of these plans \u2013 a lot of these technologies \u2013 actually turned out to be not necessarily unsuitable for the type of war that resulted in Ukraine, but it was very clear that a very different approach was necessary.\nAnd so, just like in Ukraine, Russians are utilizing and developing similar types of technologies. In fact, Ukraine is a mirror image \u2013 Ukraine war is a mirror image of military development, and so Russians and Ukrainians are trying to copy some of their successful designs and develop countermeasures to them. The key to the war in Ukraine right now when it comes to autonomous, robotic, and unmanned systems is a very quick research, development, testing, and evaluation cycle. It has shrunk from years to now weeks, and at most several months.\nAnother interesting defining feature of Russian military development of these systems is the fact that the development has now sort of migrated and morphed away from some of the defense industry majors to a very rapidly growing volunteer and startup community. So for the first time in its history, Russia actually has a semblance of a private military industry where civil society has stepped up to deliver some of the products and materials that were absent in the Russian military, starting in mid-2022 when it became clear that this war would be stationary, attritional, and possibly long term. Russians are, in fact, working on a lot of systems that were shown in Kate\u2019s presentation, and I\u2019ll get to that in just a few seconds."

            "Russian forces are striking Ukrainian military-industrial and civilian infrastructure in the near rear with improved tactical UAVs. Russian forces began leveraging tactical UAVs with extended ranges or other modifications to target Ukrainian military-industrial and civilian infrastructure in major frontline cities \u2014 both as part of Russian long-range UAV and missile strike packages and as part of a likely effort to establish persistent fire control beyond the normal 25-kilometer artillery range. Ukrainian regional officials reported that Russian forces have been actively using Molniya, Chernika, and Lancet UAVs in their strike packages against industrial infrastructure, hospitals, and military enlistment offices in the cities of Kharkiv, Sumy, Kramatorsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson since early 2025.[28] Russian forces are also using tactical UAVs to establish persistent fire control over settlements in the near rear. Russian forces have been striking Dobropillya, which some Russian sources described as an important Ukrainian logistics hub for the Pokrovsk direction, with over 70 FPV drones per day.[29]",
            "## UAV Innovations and New Tactics\nRussian forces are achieving partial BAI effects and advancing on the battlefield by taking advantage of improved technology and new combined UAV tactics. Recent Russian UAV innovations, such as increased FPV flight ranges, the incorporation of limited artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) capabilities, the proliferation of fiber optic UAVs, the integration of thermobaric warheads, the fielding of sleeper drones, and other technological adaptations, are giving Russian forces important advantages on the battlefield in Ukraine. Russian forces have also been using these technological adaptations in combination with one another to facilitate Russian advances on key Ukrainian towns. The changing UAV tactics are allowing Russian forces to conduct more sophisticated strikes on Ukrainian logistics, defensive positions, and military-industrial infrastructure.",
            "Military Learning and Future of WarfareRussian Force Generation and Technological Adaptations Update\n# Russian Drone Innovations are Likely Achieving Effects of Battlefield Air Interdiction in Ukraine\n# Russian Drone Innovations are Likely Achieving Effects of Battlefield Air Interdiction in Ukraine\nThe Russian integration of combined unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) attack tactics and adaptations is giving Russian forces important advantages on the battlefield in Ukraine and facilitating Russian advances on key Ukrainian towns. Russian UAV adaptations are likely achieving some effects of battlefield air interdiction (BAI): The use of airpower to strike targets in the near rear of the frontline to impact battlefield operations in the near term.[1] Neither Ukraine nor Russia has been able to conduct BAI using manned aircraft or UAVs due to the density and sophistication of adversary air defenses and electronic warfare (EW) over the past three years, but Russian forces are now achieving partial BAI effects in support of their offensives.[2] Russia\u2019s allies, especially the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), have enabled Russia to develop and scale the production of UAVs that are more resistant to EW interference and capable of operating at longer distances, higher speeds, and in challenging environments. Ukraine and its partners must invest urgently in kinetic anti-drone systems that are not reliant on EW to secure near-rear areas and, ultimately, frontline positions as well."

While full autonomy remains a developing capability, even basic remote control systems with limited autonomous functions have proved highly effective in combat conditions. This accessibility has enabled Ukraine to rapidly field large numbers of autonomous systems despite limited indigenous defense industrial capacity.\nThe Ukraine conflict has revealed an evolution in military force architecture. Traditional military planning distinguished between two primary categories of assets: expendable (ammunition) and survivable (high-value platforms). The drone revolution has expanded this taxonomy to include four categories:\n  * Single-use, deployable systems like conventional ammunition\n  * Low-cost systems whose loss poses no strategic consequences\n  * Medium-tier unmanned systems that commanders prefer to preserve but can afford to lose if militarily necessary\n  * High-value platforms and personnel that require protection"

Drones populate the skies 24 hours a day, streaming back images of troop movements and attacks. According to Fedorov, cloud services [basically helped Ukraine survive as a state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiJG8UjHb-g).\nThis war is, of course, not all about \u201c new technologies \u2013 as NATO calls them: AI, apps, automated systems, and more. Some of Ukraine\u2019s most urgent demands have been for and Soviet-era air defences are playing crucial roles. \u201c anti-tank obstacles \u2013 something most Europeans associate with the second world war \u2013 are making a reappearance, protecting the rows of trenches that scar the front lines. But the way both sides have put emerging technology to use in this context is revealing. The war in Ukraine employs, in one way or another, most of the technological advances the world has made over the last decades. If Europeans want to be serious about building up their defence capabilities, they need to pay close attention to and learn from Ukraine\u2019s and Russia\u2019s experiences so far. \nThis paper therefore examines the role of drones, cyber warfare, software-defined warfare and AI, and space technologies in the war in Ukraine. It reveals how the conflict has become a testing ground for new military systems. Innovation is happening at high speed. Never before have so many drones been deployed in a military confrontation. Cloud services and cyber defences have provided existential support. Software, often AI-enabled, is used to improve legacy systems. Without support from satellites, Ukraine would not be able to defend its territory.",
            "Greenwood\u2019s describes two of the most striking aspects of this war: the extensive use of non-military drones by the Ukrainian forces and the impact of Ukrainian volunteer and hobbyist drone units, such as Aerorozvidka \u2013 whose members, she \u201chave become some of the world\u2019s premier experts on building, modifying, and using small, cheap drones in warfare\u201d.\nTo some extent, Ukrainians are using these commercial, off-the-shelf drone systems simply because of their immediate availability and replaceability. But their use also reflects the impressive capabilities commercially available drones have acquired over recent years, including high-level sensors, easy-to-use controls, and seamless first-person views. Moreover, they offer these abilities at a much lower price than systems made for the military, meaning forces can accept losses \u2013 of which there are many, not least because they are not hardened with the same physical and electronic protection as military drones. \nIn addition to civilian systems, Ukrainian forces use a variety of military drones. Some of these drones were built specifically for this war, others have been in use for years, while a few have even been reintroduced into service after years of being mothballed. They range from small loitering munitions, such as the US-supplied Switchblade, a kamikaze drone \u2013 the smaller variant of which is a warhead of only a few kilogrammes \u2013 to systems weighing several thousand kilos that fly for hundreds of kilometres. An Australian company has cardboard drones. A British firm 3D-printed suicide drones. A German company over 100 AI-supported surveillance drones. The smallest available military surveillance drones, \u2013 are also in use in Ukraine. In short, Ukraine has become a testing bed for new and new-ish systems, with producers in direct contact with troops, refining their products as the fighting drags on."

      "question_context": "Assessing the role of foreign support and intervention directly impacts the strategic landscape; this dimension is essential for a comprehensive survey but is not overlap with direct tactical analysis.",
      "answer": "International actors and external military assistance have profoundly influenced the strategies and outcomes in the Russia-Ukraine war. Western nations, primarily the United States, the United Kingdom, and EU/NATO countries, have provided extensive military support to Ukraine, including weapons, ammunition, military equipment, drones, and air defense systems, amounting to approximately US $174 billion in direct military assistance by early 2025[en.wikipedia.org][diplomatmagazine.eu]. This support has evolved from emergency deliveries in 2022 to coordinated multiannual programs between 2023 and 2025, significantly enhancing Ukraine\u2019s capability to sustain high-intensity combat against the numerically superior Russian forces[diplomatmagazine.eu].\n\nThe military aid supplied by these allies has included a mixture of Soviet-era weaponry from former Warsaw Pact stocks and advanced Western systems such as HIMARS, Leopard 2 tanks, Patriot missile systems, and F-16 fighter jets preparations[ diplomatmagazine.eu]. Western intelligence services\u2014most notably from the US, UK, and NATO\u2014have provided Ukraine with real-time intelligence on Russian troop deployments, supplemented by commercial satellite networks like Starlink to secure communication channels and private sector cooperation for targeting software and fire coordination[ diplomatmagazine.eu].\n\nThis infusion of intelligence and advanced technology has compensated for Ukraine\u2019s numerical inferiority and contributed to greater flexibility and adaptability in Ukrainian operations, transforming the conflict into more of a war of attrition rather than a rapid offensive by either side[ausa.org][diplomatmagazine.eu]. The logistical contribution of neighboring countries such as Poland, Romania, and Slovakia, serving as critical corridors for arms, fuel, and humanitarian aid, further enhanced Ukraine\u2019s strategic sustainability[diplomatmagazine.eu]. Beyond material support, transnational coalitions facilitated Ukraine\u2019s integration into Western military coordination frameworks, with ongoing training programs and joint planning via NATO and EU initiatives[diplomatmagazine.eu].\n\nOn the Russian side, although it lacks comparable overt military alliances, it receives significant economic support chiefly from China, which accounted for about 35% of Russia\u2019s oil and gas export revenue in 2024, easing the impact of Western sanctions and sustaining Russia\u2019s economy[en.wikipedia.org][dgap.org]. Additionally, Iran has supplied Russia with hundreds of Shahed drones, augmenting Moscow\u2019s operational capabilities[en.wikipedia.org]. North Korea has also reportedly contributed manpower and weaponry, mitigating Russian manpower shortages[csis.org].\n\nThe strategic calculus on Russia\u2019s part has been affected by under-appreciation of Ukrainian resolve and strategic culture, which Western and Ukrainian actors have exploited by aligning their assistance to Ukraine\u2019s needs and cultural contexts[jia.sipa.columbia.edu]. Conversely, Russia\u2019s reliance on economic lifelines from external partners like China and Iran underlines a strategic vulnerability.\n\nThe potential escalation involving third-party states, such as China potentially providing lethal aid to Russia or NATO\u2019s direct military intervention, would fundamentally alter the conflict\u2019s nature and the international system\u2019s alignment[rand.org][specialeurasia.com]. Notably, no NATO troops have been deployed directly into the conflict zone, and NATO has refrained from establishing no-fly zones to avoid escalation[en.wikipedia.org].\n\nIn summary, external military assistance has shifted strategic balances by empowering Ukraine with lethal capabilities, intelligence advantage, and international logistical networks, while economic and limited military support have sustained Russia\u2019s war effort. These dynamics have not only shaped battlefield outcomes but also the broader geopolitical alignments and the potential future of European security architecture[commonslibrary.parliament.uk][diplomatmagazine.eu][dgap.org][rand.org].",

The idea this research puts forth is the importance of studying adversaries\u2019 distinctive culture and style towards national security and unique strategic predispositions to prevail against.

Therefore, military analysts must devise new ways to measure these intangible aspects of military power for forces untested by battle, and future combatants will need to prioritize the development of such aspects to avoid a painful learning curve once conflict begins. \nWhether air superiority can be achieved is critical in shaping the battlefield. Many dilemmas in the Russia-Ukraine war stem from each side\u2019s inability to establish air superiority. Layered air defenses, the effective use of man-portable air-defense systems, and low-cost one-way attack small UASs have constrained traditional air power. Although a similar difficulty in achieving air superiority could arise in a future conflict in the Indo-Pacific region, a potential North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\u2013Russia war would likely see NATO air forces control the skies, altering some of the dynamics that have shaped the battlefield in Ukraine. \n## The Conflict Has Produced Major Shifts in the International System\nThe impact of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has resounded throughout the international system. Although many of the effects have been incremental rather than revolutionary, the resulting shifts in the international system are nonetheless significant and, in some cases, likely to be long-lasting. The research team examined the war\u2019s geopolitical impact by assessing Europe\u2019s, Russia\u2019s, China\u2019s, and India\u2019s reactions and adaptations to the war and changes to the broader international system and norms.",
            "The Russia-Ukraine war puts India in a predicament. India\u2019s government has worked to maintain a close relationship with Russia and has refused to condemn the invasion or to join Western sanctions on Russia. Its main motivations are the strategic concern posed by its rivalry with China and the fear of driving Russia more closely into China\u2019s orbit. However, Russia\u2019s grand strategy will suffer a major reverse if Russian dependence on China continues to increase.\nCondemnation of Russia\u2019s invasion has reinforced international norms against military aggression. Support for Russia\u2019s invasion has been limited to a few pariah states. Even China has refused to publicly endorse the military action. In addition, international efforts to punish Russia economically have employed innovative levers to impose costs. These include barring Russia from the international banking information exchange system, complicating its ability to process transactions with other nations, and raising the cost of oil sales by restricting firms\u2019 abilities to insure tankers carrying Russian oil.\n## Consequential Events Could Reshape the Conflict\u2019s Impact\nPhoto by Sputnik/Pavel Volkov/Pool via REUTERS\nFuture events could alter the consequences and trends that the research team has identified in this analysis. The events that have the greatest potential impact are presented in this section; they include developments that could occur on the battlefield in Ukraine, events related to how the conflict ultimately ends, and outside events that would still have clear implications for the conflict in political or diplomatic terms. \nRussia uses tactical nuclear weapons inside Ukraine. This development could undermine the nuclear taboo, which, in turn, could significantly increase the risk to massed combat forces and challenge other central planning assumptions for military operations.",
            "Russia uses a kinetic anti-satellite weapon in low earth orbit against commercial targets that generates massive debris. This development would weaken persistent surveillance capabilities, potentially enhancing the ability for all states to conduct offense operations. This could heighten China\u2019s fears that the international system is unstable and raise expectations for a larger war.\nChina provides lethal military support to Russia. This development could suggest that Beijing perceives the U.S. capacity for sustained conflict as stronger than expected. This development would also challenge international humanitarian law and raise the question of whether China intends to renounce internal norms against military aggression.\nNATO directly intervenes in the Russia-Ukraine war. This development would suggest consensus that materiel and economic support for Ukraine alone cannot achieve regional security goals. This development would also drive an increase in defense production and cooperation and reduce many obstacles to Ukraine\u2019s integration with Europe.\nHow the war ends could influence long-term regional and international effects by shaping views on Russia\u2019s ambitions, European security concerns, and Ukraine\u2019s prospects of integration into Europe. The research team assessed the effects of three possible scenarios on this analysis and its findings.\nRussia succeeds in its initial objective for the invasion by militarily imposing a change of government in Kyiv. A clear Russian victory in the war would call into question whether non-Western powers might be able to reshape aspects of the international system. A Russian victory would also likely intensify European DIB reform efforts and drive regional increases in defense spending."

            "## Third Actors and Implications for International Order in the Ukraine War\nUkraine War might hugely shape the current international area and redesign a new world order (Credits: Image by from )\nOn the surface, the Ukraine war appears to be a conflict between two primary actors, namely, the Russian Federation and the sovereign nation of Ukraine. On deeper analysis, however, it can be said that the Ukraine war is an example of great power competition.\nIt is a continuation of the Cold War rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, which has now been transferred to a rivalry between the United States and the Russian Federation. As great power competition involves establishing an international order and building coalitions, alliances, and blocs, the Ukraine war is further complicated by the actions of third parties, both state and non-state actors.\nThe involvement of NATO (representing 31 nations), the European Union (27 countries, including some overlap with NATO), the G7 (whose members are all part of NATO or EU), as well as other U.S. allies, such as Japan and Australia, increases the likelihood of the war escalating into a world war. The outcome of the war will determine which of these alliances hold and which actors will participate in the resulting international order.\nThe western/U.S. side of the conflict contains many of the world\u2019s largest and most developed nations, all of whom have supported UN condemnation of the Russian invasion. The western allies have been providing weapons, money, and logistic and technological support to Ukraine. Additionally, 30 of these nations are participating in economic sanctions against Russia.\nOn the other side are the countries aiding Russia. Although Russia has no direct allies in this conflict, Moscow could have rely on Minsk and Belgrade. Belarus may already militarily. Serbia, on the other hand, is from Putin."

            "The fact of the matter remains: Long-range precision strike, drones of all types and excellent targeting information have done what complimentary arms and intelligence have always done\u2014they have supported the advance or defensive posture of competing land forces, but they have not supplanted it. Moreover, technology must be viewed in the context of both the operations that it is supporting, but also the adversarial operations that it seeks to overcome. If it is correct that Russian strategy is primarily concerned with retaining its territorial acquisitions at this point, and thus Russian military forces are focused on conducting defensive operations, and that Ukrainian land forces do not have the numbers to conduct the attack-defeat-occupy-defend sequence in conjunction with those other components of combined arms operations, then the precision strike, drones and targeting information might be the window dressing for a futile strategic position. Seen in this light, Kyiv\u2019s strategy is out of balance; that is, Kyiv\u2019s ends exceed the limits of its means. The effect of this situation has contributed to the conflict being characterized as a war of attrition. \nThe greatest risk to Ukraine\u2019s strategy for winning the war against Russia is the loss of U.S. political, financial and military support. The loss of support from other European partners closely follows in order of importance. A great deal has been written about this in other publications, and as a result, this section will examine other strategic risks."

            "#  Russia\u2019s War in Ukraine: Consequences for Europe and the World\nRussia\u2019s large-scale invasion in Ukraine, starting in February 2022, has not only ended the post-Cold War collective European security order, it has also changed Russia\u2019s interests and position in its post-Soviet neighborhood and globally. The war has fundamentally changed Russia\u2019s relations with Europe and the United States and has increased Moscow\u2019s dependency on China. While one of Moscow\u2019s war aims was to secure its traditional \u201csphere of influence\u201d by force, it has had the opposite effect.\nFirst published on July 16, 2025, as part of the CIRS Policy Brief \u201cRussia\u2019s Invasion of Ukraine: Assessments, Implications, Prospects\u201d (Georgetown University in Qatar). Access the full publication .\nThe war has undermined Russia\u2019s role as the regional hegemon in its post-Soviet neighborhood and its global positioning. One reaction was a NATO northern enlargement, with Finland and Sweden joining the alliance. While Russia brought war back to Europe, the West reacted by instituting increased substantial economic sanctions on Russia and increasing financial support and weapons supply to Ukraine. In a very short period of time, Europe\u2014the most important market for Russian oil and gas companies over the past few decades\u2014decoupled from Russian oil and gas supplies. \n### The End of Russian Hegemony",
            "Russia has been active in the Global South with its communication and disruption policy, and has been successful in convincing many countries about its side of the story regarding the war on Ukraine. Western double standards, anti-Americanism, and European colonial legacies play into Moscow\u2019s hands. With Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, Western actors are losing even more international support, while Russia maintains relations with Iran and all Arab countries.\nIn addition to Iran and North Korea, China has become a major supporter of Russia in its war against Ukraine. Beijing has no interest in Russia losing the war, but prefers a weakened Russia that must make compromises in terms of market access. Both China and Russia share an interest in ending the US\u2019s global hegemony, but have different strategies to reach this goal. While China wants to redefine and shape global norms in its interest, Russia, because of its relative economic weakness, acts as a disrupter; it subverts societies in other countries, threatens violence and nuclear war, and creates or maintains grey zones, undermining Western influence. While China seeks to change the rules of the game in the existing institutional framework, Russia seeks to disrupt the existing order when it cannot benefit from it. Russia\u2019s cooperation with China, Iran, and North Korea creates new opportunities for all sides and impacts the regional orders in the Middle East and Asia."

A new paper examining the[evolution of military assistance to Ukraine since January 2025](https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-10308/), when President Trump took office, is now available.\nDefence and security links between Ukraine, NATO members and other allies and partners started soon after Ukraine\u2019s independence in 1991. They intensified when Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but primarily took the form of training and the bilateral provision of non-lethal military equipment.\nSince Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, bilateral military assistance has been significantly stepped up, with many allies supplying lethal weapons to Ukraine for the first time. For some countries such as Germany, and historically neutral countries such as Sweden, this has represented a significant reversal of their previous defence policies which ruled out providing offensive weapons.\nMilitary assistance is being provided to Ukraine by the UK and international partners in support of [Ukraine\u2019s right to self-defence under the UN Charter](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_37750.htm#:~:text=A%20sovereign%2C%20independent%20and%20stable,most%20substantial%20of%20NATO's%20partnerships.).\nThis research briefing sets out the headline military commitments to Ukraine by its main allies and partners between February 2022 and January 2025.

Currently, Russia and Ukraine are fighting a war of attrition with the hope that the other side will be exhausted: Morale is thus a critical variable on both sides.\nAssessing will to fight is , and predicting how adversity will affect a nation\u2019s or force\u2019s morale is even more so. In some cases, dire straits appear to stiffen a nation\u2019s spine\u2014as occurred during the Blitz unleashed by Nazi Germany against the United Kingdom in World War II. In others, it triggers collapse\u2014as seen in in 2021.\nIn the short term, a U.S. cutoff would bolster morale on the Russian side and probably undermine it in Ukraine, though not necessarily severely. Moscow may reason that time is on its side and that the military balance will shift steadily in its favor. Ukraine, in contrast, may feel abandoned and thus more willing to make diplomatic sacrifices it would not have otherwise considered. It is, however, unlikely that the withdrawal of U.S. aid will do such harm to Ukrainian morale that it triggers a collapse of the country\u2019s armed forces or government. Ukraine fought with limited U.S. aid in the critical early days of the war, and there is no reason to think it would rather lay down arms than do so again.\n## 6.

As of 30 June 2025, Ukraine had received approximately \u20ac64.6 billion (US $75 billion) in military aid from the United States and about \u20ac84.7 billion (US $99 billion) from other international allies, primarily through drawdowns of existing stockpiles that were then delivered to Ukrainian forces. As exhisting stockpiles are expended, the allied industrial base has been gradually drawn in to supply Ukraine. Since January 2022 and as of August 2025, mostly Western nations have pledged at least \u20ac309 billion (US $360 billion) in aid to Ukraine, including approximately \u20ac149.3 billion (US $174 billion) in direct military assistance from individual countries. \nAdditional countries have also contributed, with Canada pledging CA$22 billion in assistance including CA$1.46 billion in military aid, Japan committing \u00a51.5 trillion in loans and grants, Australia providing A$2 billion in support, South Korea pledging US$394 million for 2024 and an additional US$100 million in April 2025, and Turkey supplying Bayraktar TB2 drones through donations and co-production agreements. \nBy the beginning of 2025, the United States has provided around half of all military aid to Ukraine, with European allies providing the other half. According to defense expert Malcolm Chalmers, at the beginning of 2025 US provided 20% of all military equipment Ukraine was using, with 25% provided by Europe and 55% produced by Ukraine. However, the 20% supplied by the US \"is the most lethal and important.\"",
            "Since 2022, no major state actor has matched the West in overt military assistance to Moscow; instead, Russia\u2019s most significant external support has been economic. China accounted for roughly 35 percent of Russia\u2019s oil and gas export revenue in 2024\u2014about US $83 billion of the $241 billion total\u2014providing a critical balance-of-payments lifeline despite Western sanctions. Iran has also supplied hundreds of Shahed loitering munitions to Russian forces, augmenting Moscow\u2019s capabilities on the battlefield. \n## Foreign military sales and aid to Ukraine\nFor a more comprehensive list, see [List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_military_aid_to_Ukraine_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War \"List of military aid to Ukraine during the Russo-Ukrainian War\").",
            "## Countries delivering military aid to Ukraine\nAlthough Ukraine is not a member of the (NATO) and does not have a military alliance with the United States or any NATO nation, from 24 January to 3 August 2022, the has tracked $84.2 billion from the 40 NATO-member countries in financial, humanitarian, and military aid to Ukraine. \nThe US has provided the most military assistance, supplying $29.3 billion from February 2022 to 3 February 2023, with a cumulative $41 billion to Ukraine as of 24 July 2023. To support Ukraine, many NATO members and allies, such as Germany and Sweden, have reversed past policies against providing offensive military aid. (EU) nations as a bloc have provided \u20ac3.1 billion in military support, including lethal arms, to Ukraine. Bulgaria, a major manufacturer of Soviet-pattern weapons, has supplied Ukraine with more than \u20ac2 billion worth of arms and ammunition, including a third of the ammunition the Ukrainian military needed in the critical, early phase of the invasion; Bulgaria also provides fuel supplies, and at times has covered 40% of the Ukrainian armed forces' fuel needs. \nBetween 2014 and 2021, the UK, US, EU, and NATO provided mostly non-lethal military aid to Ukraine. Lethal aid to the country increased in 2018, when the US began to sell it weapons, including anti-tank missiles, and Ukraine agreed to purchase combat drones from Turkey in 2019. \nIn 2022, Russia massed equipment and troops on Ukraine's borders. In response, the US worked with other NATO member states to transfer US-produced weapons to Ukraine. The UK began to supply Ukraine with and Javelin anti-tank weapons. After the invasion, NATO member states including Germany agreed to supply weapons but NATO itself did not. NATO and its members also refused to send troops into Ukraine or to establish a no fly-zone in case this led to a larger-scale war."

Ukraine\u2019s survival and fighting capacity have relied to a large extent on mobilizing and maintaining this support.\n  * The United States, the United Kingdom, and EU/NATO countries have provided massive amounts of weaponry, ammunition, military equipment, drones, and air defence systems.\n  * The US has contributed packages worth over USD 75 billion (military, humanitarian, and financial assistance), the UK and Germany have each provided multibillion packages, while Poland, France, and the Baltic States have offered proportionally significant support.\n  * Transfers included both Soviet-era weapons from former Warsaw Pact stocks and modern Western systems (HIMARS, Leopard 2, Patriot, F-16 in preparation).\n  * Assistance evolved from emergency deliveries (2022) to coordinated, multiannual programmes (2023\u20132025).\n\n  * Western intelligence services (US, UK, NATO) have provided Ukraine with real-time data on Russian troop dispositions and movements, including commercial and military satellite imagery.\n  * Commercial satellite networks (e.g., Starlink) have ensured stable, jam-resistant communications.\n  * Western private companies have cooperated with the Ukrainian military in developing targeting software, fire coordination systems, and drone integration solutions.\n  * This information flow created a decision-making and rapid-reaction advantage on the battlefield, compensating for Ukraine\u2019s numerical inferiority.",
            "* Neighbouring countries (Poland, Romania, Slovakia) became critical logistical corridors for the delivery of weapons, fuel, equipment, and humanitarian aid.\n  * Railway and road infrastructure was adapted for the rapid transport of heavy equipment.\n  * Economic support (grants, loans, budgetary assistance) enabled the Ukrainian state to pay its military, administration, and essential services despite the internal economic collapse.\n\nTransnational cooperation and institutional integration\n  * Ukraine has been gradually included in Western military coordination mechanisms, participating in planning and intelligence-sharing with NATO.\n  * The EU created the EUMAM Ukraine mission, which has trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers in member states.\n  * The G7 states and the European Union have formed joint working groups for the long-term reconstruction and modernization of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces.\n  * Multinational coordination formats have been established (the Ukraine Defence Contact Group \u2014 \u201cRamstein\u201d format), which plan monthly deliveries and training.\n\n  * The conflict has shown that in an age of interdependence, coordinated external support can partially compensate for major internal shortcomings and can sustain the fighting capacity of a smaller state against a numerically superior adversary.\n  * Transnational cooperation has reduced reaction time, accelerated technological adaptation, and integrated Ukraine into a de facto Western military network, even without formal NATO membership.",
            "Time thus became a strategic weapon: each additional month allowed Ukraine to receive military and financial support from the West, while bringing growing costs to Russia. Yet Russia continues its military pressure, betting on the difference in human and material resources between the two countries, as well as on the possible erosion of international support for Ukraine.\n. The strategy and military planning in the Russia\u2013Ukraine war show that success on the battlefield depends not only on technology and numbers, but also on accurate anticipation, adaptability, and societal resilience. The Russian blitzkrieg failed, while the Ukrainian defence succeeded through flexibility and the integration of Western support.\nany strategy must include alternative scenarios and a realistic long-term projection.\n### 2. Intelligence and information superiority\na) The fusion of intelligence sources. One of the most striking aspects of the Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict is the decisive role of intelligence fusion: HUMINT, SIGINT, OSINT, and IMINT.\n  * remained indispensable for understanding the adversary\u2019s intentions and identifying internal vulnerabilities.\n  * and provided a continuous picture of Russian troop movements and logistics.\n  * gained unprecedented importance, as data from commercial or public sources (social networks, publicly available satellite imagery) contributed to monitoring the battlefield."

      "question": "What are the projected future military implications for both Russia, Ukraine, and neighboring regions as a result of the innovations employed during the war?",
      "question_context": "Analyzing future implications and potential strategic shifts provides necessary forward-looking perspective, which is core to the topic\u2019s scope and not yet explored.",
      "answer": "The innovations employed during the Russia-Ukraine war are projected to have significant military implications for Russia, Ukraine, and neighboring regions, influencing strategic shifts and future conflict dynamics. \n\nFor Russia, the integration of combined UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) attack tactics is enabling new battlefield effects akin to battlefield air interdiction, despite challenges posed by dense air defenses and electronic warfare (EW). Russian UAV adaptations, with technological support notably from allies like China, now operate with greater resistance to EW, longer ranges, and higher speeds, facilitating advances on key Ukrainian towns. This progress is likely to maintain pressure on Ukrainian defenses unless countered by kinetic anti-drone systems not reliant on EW, which Ukraine and its partners need to develop urgently to secure rear and frontline positions[1][2]. Russia has also expanded its missile production capabilities and developed new drone variants to circumvent Ukrainian radio jamming, allowing adaptation within days, indicating that Russia is rapidly adjusting its technological approaches on the battlefield[3][4]. \n\nUkraine has demonstrated substantial innovation in unmanned systems across air, land, and sea domains, producing aerial drones for surveillance, kamikaze attacks, and anti-drone operations, alongside unmanned surface vessels that have altered control in maritime zones like the Black Sea. These innovations have helped Ukraine maintain resistance and conduct long-range strikes on Russian strategic targets, including incursions into Russian territory, surprising developments given Ukraine\u2019s relative resource constraints[3][5]. Ukraine\u2019s military has also efficiently integrated AI-enabled software, satellite communications, and overhead imagery for kinetic targeting and logistics, creating connected systems that enable faster tactical decisions. Ukraine\u2019s civilian and tech sectors have also contributed significantly by providing digital tools for intelligence sharing and emergency responses, helping sustain operations and civilian resilience[3][6]. \n\nBoth sides have shifted to creating specialized drone combat units, such as Ukraine\u2019s \u201cArmy of Drones\u201d and Russian specialized UAV regiments, marking drones\u2019 evolution from auxiliary tools to stand-alone weapons systems with dedicated command and logistics, which will influence future force structures and operational doctrines[7]. The proliferation and diversification of drones\u2014ranging from micro UAVs to autonomous naval drones\u2014have lowered costs and enabled mass deployment, dictating a continuous race in anti-drone measures including EW, close-range air defenses, and physical barriers[7]. \n\nFor neighboring regions and Europe, the conflict underscores the critical role of private and civilian technology companies in modern warfare, providing vital systems in connectivity, cyber defense, and hardware like drones, signaling a future where military capabilities increasingly depend on civilian tech ecosystems. The conflict has also changed the tempo and context of fighting, involving new actors and technologies that European military planners must consider seriously for defense development. Unlike previous conflicts, cloud services, cyber defenses, and space-based assets have been critical to Ukraine\u2019s territorial defense capabilities, highlighting the expanding role of digital and space domains in future regional security[8][9]. \n\nThe war\u2019s strategic implications for the broader region include the intensification of military cooperation within the Russia-led alliance, with countries like China, North Korea, and Iran providing lethal support and learning from battlefield-tested technologies. This cooperation may lead to the diffusion of conflict-tested military innovations into other global hotspots, potentially escalating tensions and arms races beyond the immediate conflict zone. Western support for Ukraine, delivered incrementally, has stabilized the conflict within conventional bounds and avoided nuclear escalation thus far, yet post-conflict military balances and regional stability depend on managing these escalatory risks carefully[5][10]. \n\nFurthermore, the conflict has revealed the importance of non-technological factors such as intelligence fusion (combining HUMINT, SIGINT, OSINT, IMINT) and societal resilience in modern warfare. The fusion of intelligence sources and incorporation of open-source data contribute to real-time battlefield awareness and operational effectiveness, a model likely to shape future military doctrines in the region[11]. \n\nIn sum, the innovations from the Russia-Ukraine war\u2014including drone warfare, AI-enabled systems, integrated intelligence, and civilian technology contributions\u2014are setting new precedents that will alter military capabilities, operational planning, and regional security dynamics. These adaptations highlight an evolutionary, rapid-cycle innovation environment, with both sides demonstrating the ability to quickly develop and counter new technologies, ensuring that future conflicts in the region and beyond will be fought with more integrated and technologically sophisticated forces, with important implications for defense priorities, alliance structures, and arms control efforts[3][7][8][10][11].",

Russian UAV adaptations are likely achieving some effects of battlefield air interdiction (BAI): The use of airpower to strike targets in the near rear of the frontline to impact battlefield operations in the near term.[1] Neither Ukraine nor Russia has been able to conduct BAI using manned aircraft or UAVs due to the density and sophistication of adversary air defenses and electronic warfare (EW) over the past three years, but Russian forces are now achieving partial BAI effects in support of their offensives.[2] Russia\u2019s allies, especially the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), have enabled Russia to develop and scale the production of UAVs that are more resistant to EW interference and capable of operating at longer distances, higher speeds, and in challenging environments.

            "Following the invasion in February 2022, Putin strategic Russian nuclear forces and threatened the use of nuclear weapons to defend its territory (including Ukrainian territory captured during the invasion). Within this context, Western nations methodically provided Ukraine with more advanced and long-range systems, one system at a time. For example, British missiles were not employed until May 2023, while U.S. were not provided until October 2023. U.S.-made were supplied to Ukraine in August 2024. By some accounts, nuclear war was only avoided by from the U.S. national security advisor and a from President Biden.\nThe Russia-Ukraine War provides a successful model of how incremental military aid can keep warfare at the conventional, nonnuclear level. Incremental escalation\u2014providing support and then pausing to gauge the Russian reaction before providing more advanced support\u2014contributed to the absence of a nuclear detonation in this conflict.\nInnovation is about cycles. The speed at which adversaries complete cycles of gap detection, innovation, production, and testing impacts which side has a competitive advantage. The Russia-Ukraine War is a laboratory of such innovation and adaptation, especially in drones.\nIn the air, Ukraine\u2019s use of delivered precision weapons at scale. Costing several hundred to several thousand dollars each, Ukraine produced aerial drones in 2024, with a goal to triple that total in 2025. These drones provided surveillance and artillery adjustment, delivered kamikaze attacks on personnel and equipment, and even shot down other drones.\nUkraine, a state without a navy, denied sea terrain access to a great power. Unmanned surface vessels like the Magura V5 were a game changer in the Black Sea. Built from , the Magura V5 sank or damaged several Russian . These sea drones, along with Ukrainian-built cruise missiles, contributed to Kyiv\u2019s ability to export its agricultural products after Russia withdrew from the in July 2023.",
            "Russian forces matched Ukraine\u2019s ingenuity on the battlefield. Their ability to adapt to new Ukrainian technology or tactics has improved remarkably since the war began and can now be measured in mere . One example was their introduction of , which circumvented Ukraine\u2019s radio jamming advances while still matching their predecessors\u2019 range and speed. As with most advancements in the war, this innovation was quickly adopted and subsequently by Ukraine. \nDespite rapid advances, the use of unmanned sea and aerial drones today is still an , not a revolution, of warfare. Judged through the lens of , a revolutionary advance would gain and maintain a significant advantage over adversaries over long periods of time. While innovative, the technological advancements gained through iteration provided battlefield advantage measured in days or even hours before the opponent adapted, thus making it evolutionary. \nFuture warfare will feature innovations that adapt as technologies evolve. [Encrypted AI software in drones](https://www.csis.org/analysis/ukraines-future-vision-and-current-capabilities-waging-ai-enabled-autonomous-warfare) allowed Ukraine to maintain a technological advantage, as a simple firmware upgrade could provide enhanced capabilities without the need for new hardware. Gaining advantages without updating hardware speeds the cycles of innovation \nDespite the of drones destroying tanks in Ukraine, Ukrainian military leaders are adamant that tanks remain crucial.\nTanks with infantry do what air power, indirect fires, and drones cannot do alone: seize and hold terrain. This is often the chief objective of land warfare. Ukrainian Army Lieutenant Colonel Volodymyr Dutko that his soldiers \u201cignore tanks at high risk.\u201d",
            "On the battlefield, a powerful trio of AI-enabled software, satellite communications, and overhead imagery analysis has enabled the Ukrainian military to efficiently target and deliver kinetic fires. Rapid adaptation of data analysis has enabled rapid evolution in battlefield decisions for warfighting and logistics sustainment.\nState, society, industry, and military units can now be connected directly and at speeds and scales previously unimaginable. Ukraine has created data tools to share tactical data from citizens and military units that bypass traditional government hierarchies. These tools visualize , kinetic fires, emergency response, and even the scope of . \nCompanies have used radar imagery and data from commercial satellites to help Ukrainian civilians find evacuation routes and map power grid damage for restoration without dangerous surveys. The Ukrainian application digital identification and passport system has helped displaced Ukrainians cross borders when physical documents are inaccessible. The Ukrainian tech industry recognizes it possesses several key niche capabilities for future warfare and foresees export opportunities in the future.\nThe Russia-Ukraine War previews the future role of AI and data integration in warfare. Militaries gain advantages by creating a common platform for intelligence, operations, logistics, and planning functions; developing user-friendly systems to minimize training load; and granting authority to frontline forces to rapidly evolve tactics.\n### The Centrality of the Space Domain"

Some of Ukraine\u2019s most urgent demands have been for and Soviet-era air defences are playing crucial roles. \u201c anti-tank obstacles \u2013 something most Europeans associate with the second world war \u2013 are making a reappearance, protecting the rows of trenches that scar the front lines. But the way both sides have put emerging technology to use in this context is revealing. The war in Ukraine employs, in one way or another, most of the technological advances the world has made over the last decades. If Europeans want to be serious about building up their defence capabilities, they need to pay close attention to and learn from Ukraine\u2019s and Russia\u2019s experiences so far. \nThis paper therefore examines the role of drones, cyber warfare, software-defined warfare and AI, and space technologies in the war in Ukraine. It reveals how the conflict has become a testing ground for new military systems. Innovation is happening at high speed. Never before have so many drones been deployed in a military confrontation. Cloud services and cyber defences have provided existential support. Software, often AI-enabled, is used to improve legacy systems. Without support from satellites, Ukraine would not be able to defend its territory."

            "Emerging technologies have been extensively used in the war in Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine have deployed a range of innovative military technologies, from armed drones and electronic warfare systems to cyberattacks and AI-enabled intelligence gathering. Many experts expected Russia\u2019s larger military and investment in modernizing its forces would give it a technological advantage; however, Ukraine has effectively leveraged emerging technologies to resist and launch counteroffensives. Notwithstanding the tragedy of the situation, the war in Ukraine has given us a new set of datapoints on the role of emerging technologies in warfare. The insights from the role of emerging technologies on the war in Ukraine are not straightforward. On the one hand, this war has been very conventional and exhibited a high degree of with warfare of previous decades (or even centuries). On the other hand, emerging technologies have the character of war by creating new vectors for crisis escalation, new capabilities on the battlefield, and an opportunity for new actors to play a key role in conflict. It is worthwhile to explore many of these technologies in isolation, as a suite of capabilities, and as a wider phenomenon in the war in Ukraine.",
            "To summarize, emerging technologies did not have a noticeable escalatory nor de-escalatory effect during the Ukraine crisis that would make them unique from other military capabilities and applications. Where emerging technologies potentially did have an escalatory effect was to the crisis by giving Russia a false sense of supremacy and shaping perceptions in Moscow about the likelihood of success and relatively low costs of invasion. This argument comes with an inherent humility, as no one can know what Putin\u2019s perceptions were and Kremlin decision-making is notoriously murky. While the tactical impacts might be limited, the strategic impacts of emerging technologies more broadly point to concerning trends for escalation. Nonetheless, there are other trends in the war in Ukraine that should caution against a false sense of complacency about the escalatory potential of emerging technologies, to include potential for wormhole and inadvertent escalation. Three such trends include new actors, new escalation pathways, and new timescales.",
            "We argue that emerging technologies gave Russia a false sense of supremacy in the lead-up to the war in Ukraine and have largely failed to deliver Russia battlefield victories. As a result, Moscow has increased reliance on nuclear weapons and nuclear threats. This reliance could be exacerbated in the aftermath of the war in Ukraine when Russia is conventionally weakened. Therefore, it is not the technologies themselves that increase risks of escalation, but their military contributions that could lead states to initiate or escalate conflicts. The limited role of emerging technologies on the battlefields in Ukraine should not inspire complacency. Instead, these technologies and their military applications provide a preview of ways that emerging technologies could contribute to escalation in the future both before and during conflicts."

            "The third year of the Russian war in Ukraine has brought several surprising developments, including Ukraine\u2019s incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region, the direct involvement of North Korean troops on the battlefield, and a series of long-range strikes on Russia\u2019s strategic targets conducted by Ukraine, at times with the use of autonomous technologies. The scope of this war has clearly exceeded regional dimensions and is evolving into a global confrontation. Over 50 countries have joined , collaborating to coordinate military aid. Nations from are contributing both lethal and non-lethal assistance to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Russia's military allies include the global power China, along with regional players like North Korea and Iran, whose involvement in the conflict Involvement in this war is not driven solely by ideological reasons. Allied states and private-sector actors are paying close attention to weaponry deployed on the battlefield, tested against a technologically advanced adversary, and then further refined. What could these developments mean for the world? Ukraine\u2019s military and technological innovations and the need for responsible arms control Both parties to the war, Ukraine and Russia, have significantly increased their military production since February 2022. While Ukraine cannot match Russia's weapon production in terms of quantity, it has deliberately prioritized quality. Ukraine's strategic objective is its domestic long-range capabilities and creating conditions for achieving a technological advantage over Russian forces. Ukraine's most significant military assets are unmanned aerial systems, which have [ reshaped the basic outlines of modern warfare.](https://unidir.org/publication/webinar-series-summary-armed-and-dangerous-a-brief-overview-of-uncrewed-aerial-systems-risks-impacts-and-avenues-for-action/) The [main trends in UAV development](https://kse",
            ". Collaboration with Ukrainian engineers and technical staff on producing drones, ammunition, and air defense systems is particularly attractive. Prominent players such as U.S.-based , Germany\u2019s , and Turkey\u2019s have swiftly established offices or drone manufacturing plants in Ukraine. Meanwhile, German Rheinmetall at least four factories in Ukraine to produce artillery shells, military vehicles, gunpowder, and anti-aircraft weapons. This expansion would significantly boost Ukrainian defense production amid ongoing ammunition shortages. However, in the long term, it is difficult to predict how these advanced technologies and direct involvement in the Ukrainian battlefield might be utilized in other conflicts. A notable example is the plan to deploy battle-tested American , initially used in Ukraine, to Taiwan. The Rule of Law in Armed Conflict Online Portal (RULAC), based in Geneva, tracks over . Military producers, motivated by profit, are likely to attract customers seeking battlefield-tested innovations that provide a decisive edge in warfare. Although the full impact of these developments may not be visible by 2025, it is expected that, within a few years, military technologies refined in the Russian-Ukrainian war will begin to emerge in other parts of the world, particularly in areas where Western states are engaged. Deepening military cooperation within the Russia-led alliance: potential for immediate global threats Russia its defense industry to sustain its ongoing military operations, significantly increasing production by introducing additional shifts, expanding production lines at existing facilities, and reopening decommissioned factories.

According to Fedorov, cloud services [basically helped Ukraine survive as a state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiJG8UjHb-g).\nThis war is, of course, not all about \u201c new technologies \u2013 as NATO calls them: AI, apps, automated systems, and more. Some of Ukraine\u2019s most urgent demands have been for and Soviet-era air defences are playing crucial roles. \u201c anti-tank obstacles \u2013 something most Europeans associate with the second world war \u2013 are making a reappearance, protecting the rows of trenches that scar the front lines. But the way both sides have put emerging technology to use in this context is revealing. The war in Ukraine employs, in one way or another, most of the technological advances the world has made over the last decades. If Europeans want to be serious about building up their defence capabilities, they need to pay close attention to and learn from Ukraine\u2019s and Russia\u2019s experiences so far. \nThis paper therefore examines the role of drones, cyber warfare, software-defined warfare and AI, and space technologies in the war in Ukraine. It reveals how the conflict has become a testing ground for new military systems. Innovation is happening at high speed. Never before have so many drones been deployed in a military confrontation. Cloud services and cyber defences have provided existential support. Software, often AI-enabled, is used to improve legacy systems. Without support from satellites, Ukraine would not be able to defend its territory."

            "Time thus became a strategic weapon: each additional month allowed Ukraine to receive military and financial support from the West, while bringing growing costs to Russia. Yet Russia continues its military pressure, betting on the difference in human and material resources between the two countries, as well as on the possible erosion of international support for Ukraine.\n. The strategy and military planning in the Russia\u2013Ukraine war show that success on the battlefield depends not only on technology and numbers, but also on accurate anticipation, adaptability, and societal resilience. The Russian blitzkrieg failed, while the Ukrainian defence succeeded through flexibility and the integration of Western support.\nany strategy must include alternative scenarios and a realistic long-term projection.\n### 2. Intelligence and information superiority\na) The fusion of intelligence sources. One of the most striking aspects of the Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict is the decisive role of intelligence fusion: HUMINT, SIGINT, OSINT, and IMINT.\n  * remained indispensable for understanding the adversary\u2019s intentions and identifying internal vulnerabilities.\n  * and provided a continuous picture of Russian troop movements and logistics.\n  * gained unprecedented importance, as data from commercial or public sources (social networks, publicly available satellite imagery) contributed to monitoring the battlefield.",
            "a shortage of ammunition or fuel can halt entire offensives, regardless of numerical or technological superiority.\ne) Drone technology \u2013 transforming modern warfare. One of the most visible and innovative aspects of the Russia\u2013Ukraine conflict has been the large-scale use of drones, which has profoundly changed the way military operations are conducted.\nProliferation and diversification of drones. Both sides have used a wide range of drones \u2014 from adapted commercial micro-UAVs to FPV kamikaze drones, heavy aerial vehicles, and autonomous naval drones. Their low cost, the availability of commercial components, and rapid adaptability enabled industrial-scale production and mass deployment, including in swarms.\nDrones became an integral part of the kill chain: they detect targets, transmit coordinates in real time, and guide artillery or missile strikes. Their combined use with artillery systems has significantly increased the precision and reaction speed on the battlefield.\nThe rise of specialized formations. The escalating use of drones led both armies to create dedicated formations. As early as 2023, Ukraine launched the \u201cArmy of Drones\u201d programme, which resulted in the creation of dedicated drone brigades and battalions with their own training, logistics, and command structures. Russia followed the same trend, forming by 2024 specialised UAV regiments and units within its ground and air forces. This marks the transition of drones from auxiliary means to stand-alone weapons with their own decision chains.\nThe mass use of drones has forced the development of specific countermeasures. Both sides have heavily invested in:\n  * electronic warfare (jamming, spoofing, disruption of command links and GPS/GLONASS signals);\n  * close-range air defence (automatic cannons, optically guided machine guns, programmable ammunition, MANPADS);\n  * improvised physical barriers (metal nets, cages, light armour on vehicles and fixed positions)."

            "Competency matters as much, if not more, than technology. The conflict has underscored the importance of \u201csoft\u201d aspects of military power, such as tactical proficiency, sound operational planning, and coherent strategy. Therefore, military analysts must devise new ways to measure these intangible aspects of military power for forces untested by battle, and future combatants will need to prioritize the development of such aspects to avoid a painful learning curve once conflict begins. \nWhether air superiority can be achieved is critical in shaping the battlefield. Many dilemmas in the Russia-Ukraine war stem from each side\u2019s inability to establish air superiority. Layered air defenses, the effective use of man-portable air-defense systems, and low-cost one-way attack small UASs have constrained traditional air power. Although a similar difficulty in achieving air superiority could arise in a future conflict in the Indo-Pacific region, a potential North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)\u2013Russia war would likely see NATO air forces control the skies, altering some of the dynamics that have shaped the battlefield in Ukraine. \n## The Conflict Has Produced Major Shifts in the International System\nThe impact of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has resounded throughout the international system. Although many of the effects have been incremental rather than revolutionary, the resulting shifts in the international system are nonetheless significant and, in some cases, likely to be long-lasting. The research team examined the war\u2019s geopolitical impact by assessing Europe\u2019s, Russia\u2019s, China\u2019s, and India\u2019s reactions and adaptations to the war and changes to the broader international system and norms.",
            "Russia uses a kinetic anti-satellite weapon in low earth orbit against commercial targets that generates massive debris. This development would weaken persistent surveillance capabilities, potentially enhancing the ability for all states to conduct offense operations. This could heighten China\u2019s fears that the international system is unstable and raise expectations for a larger war.\nChina provides lethal military support to Russia. This development could suggest that Beijing perceives the U.S. capacity for sustained conflict as stronger than expected. This development would also challenge international humanitarian law and raise the question of whether China intends to renounce internal norms against military aggression.\nNATO directly intervenes in the Russia-Ukraine war. This development would suggest consensus that materiel and economic support for Ukraine alone cannot achieve regional security goals. This development would also drive an increase in defense production and cooperation and reduce many obstacles to Ukraine\u2019s integration with Europe.\nHow the war ends could influence long-term regional and international effects by shaping views on Russia\u2019s ambitions, European security concerns, and Ukraine\u2019s prospects of integration into Europe. The research team assessed the effects of three possible scenarios on this analysis and its findings.\nRussia succeeds in its initial objective for the invasion by militarily imposing a change of government in Kyiv. A clear Russian victory in the war would call into question whether non-Western powers might be able to reshape aspects of the international system. A Russian victory would also likely intensify European DIB reform efforts and drive regional increases in defense spending."

            "The security-insecurity paradox in a geopolitical struggle between Russia and its ex-territory; Ukraine along with the politics of the influences between great powers has made the Russian invasion a reality. Russian intervention in its periphery in February 2022 has sent shockwaves to the European Union and NATO members, and posed various challenges to the Eurasian states. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is a protracted one, but this new phase is more complex and multi-layered. Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol in 2014, and support to the militant separatists in Donbas, undermined Ukrainian sovereignty. A series of border skirmishes occurred during 2014-2021, which led to thousands of people dead and injured.[1] The tension converted into a humanitarian crisis with millions of refugees and collateral damages after the 2022 war. This recent situation can be termed as a geopolitical warfare, which is based on the politics of security to assert political advantages in the desired geopolitical sphere of influence. In this paper, an effort has been made to examine the structural, bilateral, and regional issues that have led Russia to engage in a risky war. It hypothesise that this war cannot be recognized only as a bilateral war between Russia and Ukraine based on the old issues, rather it is the result of new developments in the shape of Ukraine\u2019s pursuit for a new identity and affinity with West, its bid for NATO membership and as a client of US and EU against Russia in the great power rivalry. The theoretical lens of Neo-Realism and the security dilemma best explains the causes of the war between the two. Finally, this study also endeavours to trace some important implications for the Eurasian Region. [1] Conflict-Related Civilian Casualties in Ukraine.

            "The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has emerged as a significant geopolitical tension, with far-reaching implications for global stability and security. This paper intends to study the impact of the war on the worlds and regional economic development and political stability, and achieve some findings that may trigger further policy considerations in mitigating challenges and issues imposed by the war. Through literature reviews and comparison analysis, the findings reveal economic, political, and security consequences of the conflict. The disruption of trade flows, economic sanctions, and uncertainty have impacted both Russia and Ukraine, as well as the wider region and the world. Energy security concerns and shifts in military alliances have added to the complexity of the conflict. The expansion of NATO and increased rivalries between Russia and Western countries have further heightened tensions. Based on the findings, the paper concludes that the Russia-Ukraine conflict poses a significant threat to global economic stability and political security. It emphasizes the need for a multilateral approach to address the conflict and promote peace and stability in the region. Ceasefire agreements, humanitarian assistance, and reconstruction efforts are crucial steps towards long-term peace and development. The paper highlights the importance of prioritizing diplomatic solutions over short-term gains from the conflict. In summary, this paper intends to explore the implications of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on global stability and security, with findings that underscore the need for international cooperation and concerted efforts to mitigate the consequences of the conflict and foster a peaceful resolution."
