    "The proliferation of drone warfare in the Russia-Ukraine conflict from 2022\u20132024 evidences a paradigmatic shift toward technology-driven, asymmetric military strategies, with Ukraine's adoption of long-range UAVs for cross-border operations signaling a new era of cost-effective, precision warfare that is likely to reshape regional security doctrines across Eastern Europe.",
    "Despite large numbers of drone, missile, and artillery strikes on civilian infrastructure, low per-event fatality rates combined with the routine occurrence of high-precision attacks suggest a strategic shift aimed not at mass casualties, but at long-term disruption, economic attrition, and internal destabilization, offering a blueprint for future 'hybrid warfare' where technology is weaponized for persistent low-intensity conflict."
