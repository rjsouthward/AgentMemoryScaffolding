      "question": "What statistics and sources demonstrate the scale and growth of drone warfare by both Russia and Ukraine in the conflict from 2022\u20132024?",
      "question_context": "This addresses the foundational need to cite quantitative evidence of proliferation and helps establish the premise for the thesis regarding a paradigmatic shift.",
      "answer": "Russia began the 2022 invasion with an estimated pre-war UAV fleet of approximately 2,000 drones, while Ukraine had considerably fewer; however, by 2023-2024, both countries massively scaled up drone usage and production to unprecedented levels. Current figures indicate Russia has utilized up to 1.4 million aerial drones, while Ukraine has deployed about 1.5 million UAVs in total since the conflict began, signifying escalation to the scale of millions of drones used regularly in the fighting[1][2]. Russia\u2019s drone manufacturing capacity has notably increased, with the Kremlin reportedly producing more than 6,000 Shahed-type strike drones monthly after initially purchasing them from Iran[2]. This factory in Alabuga, Tatarstan, dramatically reduced the cost of these drones from around $200,000 per unit in 2022 to approximately $70,000 by 2025, with some estimates placing costs as low as $20,000-$50,000 per drone[2]. Russia\u2019s nightly barrages have grown accordingly, with records showing it launched a total of 6,443 drones and missiles into Ukraine in July 2025, marking the highest monthly total of the war and averaging around 201 drone attacks daily[3]. Ukraine has correspondingly ramped up its drone production, manufacturing roughly 800,000 drones in 2023 and 2 million in 2024, with projections of up to 5 million additional UAVs expected within 2025[1][4].\n\nThe conflict\u2019s drone warfare is characterized not only by sheer volume but also by tactical innovation. Ukraine has adopted a decentralized, volunteer-driven, networked drone production and deployment approach, leveraging hundreds of companies and grassroots initiatives to supply as much as 90% of its battlefield UAVs[5]. In contrast, Russia has adopted a more centralized, technologically evolving model, integrating AI capabilities such as terminal guidance, target-lock, and image recognition into its drones, alongside large-scale production and recent innovations such as fiber optic-controlled drones that evade conventional electronic warfare methods[1][6]. Both nations have been driven by military necessity to compensate for limited air force capabilities, using drones extensively for surveillance, targeted strikes, and electronic warfare[2][5].\n\nThese figures and developments illustrate a paradigmatic shift in military aviation and warfare. The use of drones has escalated to replace traditional artillery in many scenarios\u2014where artillery shells are scarce, drones serve as consumable munitions with tactical benefit, deployed by the hundreds of thousands and becoming integral to daily combat operations[1][7]. Consequently, drone warfare in this conflict exemplifies a transformation in battlefield dynamics, pushing both Russia and Ukraine to pursue rapid innovation and production expansion, making the 2022\u20132024 Russia-Ukraine conflict a defining case of large-scale unmanned aerial warfare in modern warfare history[2][5][7].\n\nReferences:\n[1] www.csis.org \u2013 Russia started with ~2,000 UAVs, now millions deployed; Ukraine about 1.5 million UAVs utilized, Russia about 1.4 million; drones replacing artillery shells.\n[2] www.cnn.com \u2013 Russia produces 6,000+ Shahed drones monthly in 2025; drone cost reduced significantly; Russia launched 700+ drones nightly; Ukraine producing millions of drones.\n[3] abcnews.go.com \u2013 July 2025: Russia launched record 6,443 drones/missiles; average ~201 drones daily; interception rates detailed.\n[4] www.nationaldefensemagazine.org \u2013 Ukraine produced ~800,000 drones in 2023, 2 million in 2024, expecting 5 million more; Russia used ~1.4 million UAVs in 2024.\n[5] www.tandfonline.com \u2013 Ukraine\u2019s decentralized drone manufacturing by 200+ companies, 90% supply from whole-of-society production.\n[6] www.nationaldefensemagazine.org \u2013 Russia integrating AI for terminal guidance and target recognition; deploying fiber optic-controlled drones.\n[7] www.atlanticcouncil.org \u2013 Drones now account for a significant portion of casualties; drones replacing artillery in parts of conflict; innovation ongoing.",

            "Another defining feature of this war are sheer numbers. And in the beginning of this invasion, Russia probably went in with its pre-2022 fleet of approximately 2,000 UAVs. That\u2019s the number that was quoted in all official publications. Well, now we\u2019re dealing with millions of UAVs on a regular basis. So last year Ukraine utilized about 1.5 million UAVs in total; Russia probably utilized up to 4 million UAVs.

And in many ways, drones are actually replacing artillery shells where artillery shells are absent or in very short supply. And now, after several years of this conflict, after all of this technological development, and after all of the \u2013 all of the systems that were used in the war, Russians are saying that they and the Ukrainians are actually ahead of the entire world when it comes to the application of many tactical technologies such as UAVs and counter-UAV systems."

            "#  How Russia\u2019s drone attacks have reshaped the war in Ukraine: An illustrated guide \nUpdated Sep 2, 2025, 12:53 PM ET\nPUBLISHED Aug 22, 2025, 12:01 AM ET\nAs Russia\u2019s war machine grinds forward in eastern Ukraine, there is another offensive being waged far beyond the front line. Russia is ramping up nightly drone attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure, and as it rapidly increases its production of those weapons its strikes are intensifying. \nMany of the drones aren\u2019t particularly fast or high-tech, but they are cheap enough for the Kremlin to launch more than 700 in one night, in an effort to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s air defenses and decimate civilian morale, experts say. \nAfter obtaining Iranian designs for Shahed attack drones, Russia [built its own massive factory](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/europe/russia-drone-factory-iran-intl) to churn out thousands of these weapons each month. Its evolving tactics are forcing Ukraine to fight back with more expensive ammunition and innovations, as less costly methods of defense become less effective. \nThe rapid increase in drone strikes shows how warfare has evolved to rely on these unmanned autonomous vehicles. \nUkraine and Russia have been driven to improve drone capabilities to compensate for deficiencies in air force capabilities, a dynamic that isn\u2019t applicable to all Western powers. But experts say that the United States and its European NATO allies are actively working to improve drones and counter-drone operations to retain an advantage in any future conflicts. \n\u201cNATO will probably end up using drones on a large scale. Not at the same scale as Russia and Ukraine, because we\u2019ve got these massive air forces that we\u2019ve invested in and that can strike with a lot of power very quickly \u2013 but as a complement to that,\u201d Robert Tollast, a research fellow focused on land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told CNN.",
            "Taiwan is already looking into developing large numbers of cheap attack drones, Tollast said. Non-state actors across the globe and drug cartels are also increasingly relying on drones. \u201cThese are going to pose a huge challenge to unprepared armies around the world,\u201d he added. \nThis is how Russia\u2019s drone campaign operates \u2013 and how Ukraine is working to fight back. \nRussia is moving toward producing more than 6,000 Shahed-type drones each month, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Intelligence told CNN. And it\u2019s much cheaper to produce the attack drones inside Russia compared to earlier in the war, when Moscow was purchasing them from Tehran. \n\u201cIn 2022, Russia paid an average of $200,000 for one such drone,\u201d a Ukrainian Defense Intelligence source said. \u201cIn 2025, that number came down to approximately $70,000,\u201d due to the large-scale production at the Alabuga drone factory in Russia\u2019s Tatarstan region. \nBut cost estimates vary greatly \u2013 the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a DC-based think tank, found that estimates for Shahed-136s ranged from $20,000 to $50,000 per drone. By comparison, a single surface-to-air missile interceptor can cost more than $3 million. \nThat relatively low cost makes it possible for the Kremlin to ramp up its nightly drone attacks, as well as conduct more frequent large-scale attacks. Earlier in the war, major missile-and-drone salvos happened roughly once a month. By mid-2025, they occured every eight days on average, according to by CSIS. \nTo many civilians, the constant threat of drone attacks is terrifying. \nAn apartment building is heavily damaged following a Russian drone strike in Odesa, Ukraine, on July 24, 2025.\nKyiv resident Bohdana Zhupanyna was heavily pregnant when her family\u2019s apartment was obliterated by a Russian drone strike in July."

            "# Russia launches 6,400 drones, missiles into Ukraine in record-breaking month\nThe scale of Russia's nightly strikes has been steadily increasing.\nAugust 1, 2025, 1:07 AM\nMore than three years into Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukrainians across the country retreat each night to bomb shelters and metro stations in a nightly ritual necessitated by the long reach of Moscow's drones and missiles. This summer, Ukrainians are spending more time in such shelters than ever before.\nThe first bombardments of Kyiv and other major cities began in the early morning of Feb. 24, 2022, as Russian troops surged across Ukraine's borders on several axes. In the years since, the attacks have never stopped.\nThrough July, Russia launched a record 6,443 drones and missiles into the country, according to data published by the Ukrainian air force. The total is the highest of the war to date, and around 13% more than were recorded in June.\nThe scale and complexity of Russia's drone and missile barrages have steadily increased through the war. The Iranian-designed Shahed strike drone -- adopted enthusiastically by the Russian military and rebranded as the Geran -- has become the workhorse of Moscow's nightly harassment of Ukrainian cities and vital infrastructure.\nFor many Ukrainians, the \"flying mopeds,\" as the Shahed and Geran variants have become known due to their distinctive sound, are emblematic of the Russian threat.\nThe strikes are terrorizing and deadly. June saw the highest monthly level of Ukrainian civilian casualties in more than three years, according to data published by the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine -- 232 people killed and 1,343 people injured.\nAn explosion of a Russian drone is seen in Kyiv, Ukraine, on July 21, 2025.",
            "Neither Russia nor Ukraine publish data detailing the scale of their own strike campaigns. Ukraine's air force publishes a daily tally of Russian drone and missile strikes, while Russia's Defense Ministry only publishes figures of Ukrainian drones shot down.\nJuly marked a high-water mark for Russian drone attacks on Ukraine. Data published by the Ukrainian air force and analyzed by ABC News recorded a total of 6,245 attack and decoy drones launched into the country over the past month at an average rate of around 201 per day.\nRussia also launched 198 missiles, with an average of more than six each day.\nThough Ukraine's interception rate is significant, plenty of projectiles arrive with devastating effect. July saw around 89% of drones and around 61% of missiles shot down or otherwise suppressed.\nBy comparison, June saw 5,438 drones and 239 missiles fired into Ukraine, with a daily average of 181 drones and nearly eight missiles. The air force downed or suppressed 87.2% of all drones and 73% of missiles during June.\nAnd in May, Russia launched a total of 3,835 drones and 117 missiles, for an average of around 124 drones and nearly four missiles each day. Across the month, 85.7% of drones and 57% of missiles were shot down or suppressed.\n\"Right now, Ukraine sees around 300 to 400 drones attacking civilian targets every day -- these types of numbers were unheard of in 2023 or 2024,\" Yuriy Boyechko, the founder and CEO of the Hope for Ukraine charity, told ABC News.\nMoscow shows no sign of letting up. Russian officials and media have made much of the country's growing drone production capabilities. A recent report by the Zvezda television channel, for example, showed operations at a Geran factory in Alabuga in Russia's Republic of Tatarstan, with workers constructing and piling up dozens of attack drones ready for delivery."

Some 400,000 Ukrainian troops and close to 1 million invading Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since the war started in 2022, and Western analysts estimate that just under half of Russia's casualties occurred last year, largely because of the widening use of drones. Mechanized assaults are almost impossible in the drone age: a $400 drone can quickly take out a $2 million tank, and of the 31 M1A1 Abrams tanks the to Ukraine in 2023, all but four have been destroyed. The proliferation of eyes in the sky means soldiers must advance in small groups, on foot or on motorbikes. UAVs have also \"gamified\" the war: Under a Ukrainian program, pilots earn points for each video of a confirmed drone strike. Eliminating a tank gets eight points, a Russian drone pilot 25. Those points can then be traded in for more effective weapons, an incentive intended to direct equipment to the best units.\nOur editors scour hundreds of sources across the globe to bring you the facts on current controversies, plus incisive analysis from a wide array of perspectives \u2013 for less than $2.50 a week!\nLatest Videos From The Week\n## Can you defend against drones?"

            "As Russia\u2019s summer offensive continues to unfold along a front line measuring hundreds of miles, Ukraine\u2019s overstretched military finds itself heavily reliant on drones to prevent any major breakthroughs. The Ukrainian military\u2019s innovative and rapidly evolving use of unmanned aerial vehicles to create a layered defense is often referred to as a \u201c.\u201d If this Ukrainian drone wall can prove itself over the coming months and blunt Putin\u2019s big offensive, this will likely shape future defensive doctrine in military academies across Europe and beyond.\nThe military use of unmanned aerial vehicles has evolved dramatically since the onset of Russia\u2019s invasion more than three years ago, leading many to call the current conflict the world\u2019s first ever full-scale drone war. As the invasion enters a fourth summer, drones are currently thought to account for of all Russian and Ukrainian battlefield casualties.\nUkraine\u2019s drone wall tactics emerged out of military necessity and are part of this far broader shift toward the dominance of unmanned systems on the modern battlefield. Following Russia\u2019s victory in the Battle of Avdiivka in early 2024, Ukraine found itself on the defensive and facing of artillery amid delays in anticipated US aid. Kyiv responded by turning to drones as a cheap and effective substitute for more conventional munitions.\nWhile drones lack the firepower to completely replace artillery, Ukraine\u2019s deployment of drones to create defensive corridors many miles deep has proved remarkably effective. Drones are used both for surveillance purposes and to conduct airstrikes, making it extremely difficult for enemy forces to concentrate and launch large-scale offensive operations. The impact of this approach can be seen in the sheer scale of the damage being done to Putin\u2019s invading army. Britain\u2019s _International Institute for Strategic Studies_ has that Russian losses in 2024 included around 1400 tanks along with more than 3700 armored vehicles.",
            "#### As the world watches the Russian invasion of Ukraine unfold, UkraineAlert delivers the best Atlantic Council expert insight and analysis on Ukraine twice a week directly to your inbox.\nAs Ukraine\u2019s drone wall has taken shape over the past eighteen months, Russian commanders have been forced to adapt their own tactics. Instead of depending on large armored columns to punch through Ukrainian defenses, Russia has becoming increasingly reliant on small infantry units working to achieve local advances. Rather than traveling in armored vehicles, soldiers now often use highly mobile forms of transport such as and buggies in order to evade drones.\nRussia is mirroring Ukraine\u2019s progress in the field of drone warfare as the two nations compete in a daily race to innovate and gain a battlefield advantage. At present, the Russians have managed to achieve a significant edge through the large-scale manufacture and deployment of drones operated via fiber optic cables. This has been hailed by some as a game changer as such models cannot be jammed using existing electronic warfare tools.\nMeanwhile, Russia is increasingly targeting Ukrainian drone operators and the radar stations they depend on. This is making it significantly more difficult for Ukraine to maintain comprehensive drone coverage in depth along the front lines of the war, while creating gaps for Russian infantry units to exploit. \nThe strength of Ukraine\u2019s drone wall depends on a number of factors including increased volumes, technological advances, and integration into existing military structures. Domestic Ukrainian drone production has skyrocketed since 2022, with hundreds of new companies entering the market. As a result, annual output is set to reach this year, according to Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov."

            "# Ukraine-Russia drone war escalation will continue\n## Both militaries are expanding their use of drones, though in different ways that reflect their resource asymmetries\nOn June 1, Ukraine launched a large-scale and coordinated attack on Russia\u2019s long-range bomber force thousands of kilometres from the frontline. Aerial drones are now central to both sides\u2019 military operations. Ukraine has adopted a decentralised, adaptable \u2018network\u2019 approach to drone production. Russia\u2019s is more organised, relying initially on Iranian technology, though it too has become increasingly innovative and has embraced cheaper models that seek to overwhelm Ukrainian air defences.\nRussia and Ukraine will expand the production of drones of all types and develop innovative ways to employ this cost-effective and increasingly effective technology. The expansion of drone output and utilisation will enable both sides to expand the range of targets they can hold under threat \u2014 on the battlefield and deep behind the frontline \u2014 even as the role of traditional combat aircraft declines.\nThe Ukrainian drone strike on multiple Russian air bases, known as Operation Spiderweb, inflicted a serious blow to Russia\u2019s long-range strategic bomber fleet ([see UKRAINE: Airbase attack could elicit severe response \u2013 June 2, 2025](https://dailybrief.oxan.com/Analysis/ES295099)).\nThe attack took place after Russia increased the tempo of its drone strikes on Ukraine, with hundreds of drones targeting Ukraine each night since mid-May. Ukraine\u2019s ability to strike as far as eastern Siberia marks a new level of operational sophistication.\nInitial independent assessments indicate the attack destroyed at least eight Tu-95 bombers and four Tu-22M bombers. In addition, at least one A-50M airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft appears to have been destroyed. Satellite analysis suggests the most significant losses were recorded at the Belaya airfield in Russia\u2019s Far East and Olenya airbase in the Arctic."

            "The West should continue to invest in Ukrainian anti-drone innovations, as the United States and its allies may face similar modern warfare dilemmas in the near future. The PRC is seemingly intensifying its covert support of the Russian UAV and counter-drone systems production efforts and is likely learning valuable technological and tactical lessons to accommodate Russian parts and equipment orders. The adversary entente of Russia, the PRC, North Korea, and Iran may use these lessons in future wars against the United States or its allies.\nRussia\u2019s current technological advantage on the frontlines is concerning, but it can likely be made fleeting. Ukraine\u2019s ability to adapt, develop new countermeasures, and innovate existing technologies and tactics is one of the key rate determiners of Russia\u2019s ability to sustain efforts to achieve some effects of BAI that have been facilitating Russian advances in Spring and Summer 2025.\n*Ukrainian military analysts describe the \u201ckill zone\u201d as an area of elevated drone strike risk, in contrast to the US doctrine, which describes the \u201ckill zone\u201d as an area in which drones can strike any equipment or personnel that enters the area. Ukrainian military analysts argue that both Russian and Ukrainian forces continue to operate in these drone \u201ckill zones\u201d for extended periods of time, where they are exposed to elevated drone strike risks but are not always hit with drone strikes upon entering or operating in the area."

            "#  How Russia\u2019s drone attacks have reshaped the war in Ukraine: An illustrated guide \nUpdated Sep 2, 2025, 12:53 PM ET\nPUBLISHED Aug 22, 2025, 12:01 AM ET\nAs Russia\u2019s war machine grinds forward in eastern Ukraine, there is another offensive being waged far beyond the front line. Russia is ramping up nightly drone attacks on Ukrainian cities and civilian infrastructure, and as it rapidly increases its production of those weapons its strikes are intensifying. \nMany of the drones aren\u2019t particularly fast or high-tech, but they are cheap enough for the Kremlin to launch more than 700 in one night, in an effort to overwhelm Ukraine\u2019s air defenses and decimate civilian morale, experts say. \nAfter obtaining Iranian designs for Shahed attack drones, Russia [built its own massive factory](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/08/europe/russia-drone-factory-iran-intl) to churn out thousands of these weapons each month. Its evolving tactics are forcing Ukraine to fight back with more expensive ammunition and innovations, as less costly methods of defense become less effective. \nThe rapid increase in drone strikes shows how warfare has evolved to rely on these unmanned autonomous vehicles. \nUkraine and Russia have been driven to improve drone capabilities to compensate for deficiencies in air force capabilities, a dynamic that isn\u2019t applicable to all Western powers. But experts say that the United States and its European NATO allies are actively working to improve drones and counter-drone operations to retain an advantage in any future conflicts. \n\u201cNATO will probably end up using drones on a large scale. Not at the same scale as Russia and Ukraine, because we\u2019ve got these massive air forces that we\u2019ve invested in and that can strike with a lot of power very quickly \u2013 but as a complement to that,\u201d Robert Tollast, a research fellow focused on land warfare at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told CNN."

            "Drone warfare has become a key feature of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, changing how modern wars are fought. Both sides use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for surveillance, intelligence gathering, precision strikes, and electronic warfare. These drones offer real-time insights and reduce risks to soldiers, allowing for more efficient and targeted operations. However, drones are also vulnerable to jamming and cyber-attacks, prompting heavy investment in advanced drone tech and countermeasures. The conflict has become a testing ground for new UAV capabilities, influencing global military tactics and defence planning. \nPettyjohn, Stacie. \u201cEvolution Not Revolution: Drone Warfare in Russia\u2019s 2022 Invasion of Ukraine.\u201d Center for a New American Security, 2024. \nThis report concludes that drones have transformed the battlefield in the war in Ukraine, but in an evolutionary rather than revolutionary fashion. While tactical innovation abounds and drones offer some new capabilities, their impact falls short of the truly disruptive change that constitutes a so-called revolution in military affairs. For the most part, Russian and Ukrainian drones remain piloted by humans, are not broadly networked together, and are small, which means their effects tend to be localized. In part, drones have not offered Ukrainians or Russians a decisive edge on the battlefield because both parties are engaged in a fast-paced two-sided cycle of innovation and emulation. Because many drone technologies are commercial or dual use, they can be easily acquired, meaning that innovations quickly diffuse to the enemy. Russian forces have been fast followers in adopting commercial and do-it-yourself (DIY) kamikaze drones. Similarly, Ukrainian forces have tried to match the quantity and quality of Russia\u2019s military drones, but given the military-specific technologies involved, the Ukrainians have been unable to fully close this gap."

            "JUST IN: As Russia-Ukraine War Continues, Russia\u2019s Drone Technologies Evolve\n## JUST IN: Russia Expands Drone Capabilities as Ukraine Conflict Continues (UPDATED)\nWhile many of Ukraine\u2019s technological advancements resulting from the war with Russia are well-known, Russian capabilities are also continuing to evolve, including the integration of artificial intelligence into drones, experts said May 28.\nThe war has been laden with drone-related innovations since its beginning, with each innovation giving rise to a counter-innovation on the opposing side, experts said during a panel discussion hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\u201cJust like Ukraine, [the] Russian military is working on [the] development of artificial intelligence and integration of certain forms of AI in their drones,\u201d said Samuel Bendett, senior associate at the center\u2019s Europe, Russia and Eurasia program.\nBendett said Russia is currently using AI for terminal guidance, target lock and image recognition. A drone operator is still needed to direct the system and approve the target, while the AI is used to correctly lock and fly to the human-designated target, he explained.\nLike Ukraine, Russia is also working toward improved battlefield data collection and analysis and is developing AI to aid in decision-making and data gathering, he said. \n\u201cRussians are calling for the greater integration of different types of robotic systems from multiple domains in a single sort of unified information battlefield space,\u201d Bendett said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s going to happen soon is an open question.\u201d\nRussia\u2019s military has long placed a \u201cmassive emphasis\u201d on AI research and development to incorporate greater autonomy for data analysis, decision-making and faster action, Bendett said. He described a recent \u201cgroundswell of volunteer and startup activities who have access to commercial technologies,\u201d enabling each to incorporate AI into their products.",
            "\u201cI think if this conflict were to continue, or if we\u2019re looking at how [the] Russian military is going to be influenced by what happened in Ukraine, I think artificial intelligence and autonomy is going to be at the top of that agenda,\u201d Bendett said.\nGregory Allen, director of CSIS\u2019 Wadhwani AI Center and the panel\u2019s moderator, said: \u201cRussia doesn\u2019t want the world to have a perfectly accurate understanding of what all their capabilities are,\u201d which can make it tough to determine their current undertakings.\nAs for Ukraine, Kateryna Bondar, a fellow at the Wadhwani AI Center, said Kyiv\u2019s AI capabilities come from open source, available technologies, resulting in the Ukrainian commercial sector reaching its \u201cglass ceiling\u201d as of late. To continue to improve, they will need more resources, she explained.\n\u201cThe Ukrainian AI future would depend on the amount of investment and how committed [the] Ukrainian government would be on developing this specific technology,\u201d she said.\nOther innovative drone concepts have continued to arise in Ukraine because of the war, such as a mothership drone that can drop up to six first-person view drones, interceptor drones that can stop Russian weapons and sea systems that use Starlink to stay connected, she said.\nThe \u201csecret sauce\u201d behind Ukraine\u2019s recent military tech success is its ability to streamline its drone acquisition process, she said. A system can now be tested, evaluated and agreed upon within a week. She described this as \u201cunprecedented speed for most \u2026 Western militaries.\u201d\nUkraine produced roughly 800,000 drones in 2023, Bondar said. In 2024, the country produced 2 million drones and is expecting to produce up to 5 million more before this year is through, she said.",
            "Ukraine isn\u2019t alone in expanding its drone fleet. At the beginning of the invasion, Russia had a fleet of approximately 2,000 uncrewed aerial vehicles \u2014 a number which has since grown to millions, according to Bendett. Last year, Russia utilized up to 1.4 million aerial drones, he said.\nAmid mass production and procurement, developments continue to take place.\n\u201cRussians are saying that they and the Ukrainians are actually ahead of the entire world when it comes to the application of many tactical technologies, such as UAVs and counter-UAV systems,\u201d Bendett said.\n_Clarification: The original version of this story relayed that Samuel Bendett said that in 2024 \"Russia utilized up to 4 million aerial drones,\" while Bendett intended to say \"Russia utilized up to 1.4 million aerial drones.\" This story has been updated with the clarification._"

            "Past studies sporadically addressed the proliferation of weaponized commercial drones across African and Middle Eastern countries and, paradoxically, in Eastern Ukraine since 2014. While these activities are well documented by non-governmental watchdog organizations, the offensive use of these drones remains undertheorized. Their consequences for warfare are not well understood. Such treatments of emergent non-Western drone warfare focused on small drones as threats to defend against, not as tactical exemplars. Furthermore, the field\u2019s common expectation that emerging technologies and military innovation yield high-tech weapons seems to have limitations given the evidence from Ukraine.\nDrone developments in Ukraine have already led some scholars to nuance the previous conclusions about the military drone revolution. Although the use of cheap and essentially disposable drones by both Ukraine and Russia alter political and economic cost calculations (Kreps & Lushenko, ; Schneider & Macdonald, ), their game-changing effects on war have yet to manifest (Kunertova, ). However, while the war in Ukraine is being fought primarily with traditional artillery, tanks, bombs, and missiles, the less resourced Ukrainians are finding drones indispensable due to their high demand for basic ammunition and precision-guided weapon shortages. As Ch\u00e1vez and Swed () point out, Ukraine has \u201cmacgyvered innovations\u201d to fight modern total war with cheap, dual-use commercial drones.\nThe conflict has demonstrated that scholars need to expand the bandwidth of their research to reflect drone diversity on the battlefield. Accordingly, this article provides recommendations for further research on drones aimed at filling scholarly gaps that should be of great interest to policymakers. Ultimately, this article contributes to the ongoing debate on how drone technology is changing the character of war.",
            "In Ukraine as well as in Russia, small drones proliferate and get weaponized from within. While Russia is catching up with years of neglecting its domestic industrial base through a vertical and centralized supply chain, Ukraine relies on a horizontal chain of volunteers. Grassroots charity organizations, such as Come Back Alive, have been fundraising money for purchasing drones and coordinating drone assembly and repair in small workshops for the Ukrainian forces since 2014. By August 2023, whole-of-society drone manufacturing supplied some 90 percent of Ukrainian drones, including both reconnaissance and explosive-loaded systems (Steavenson, ). More than 200 official drone manufacturing companies, and hundreds of unlicensed and atomized techno-guerillas (Lespinois, ), are pouring thousands of drones onto the front lines. Ch\u00e1vez and Swed () further detail innovation mechanisms behind drone proliferation in Ukraine.\nThe war in Ukraine is simply unlike the drone wars of yesteryears discussed in academic literature. It has showed that drones have boots. They help foot soldiers on the ground obtain better battlespace awareness and assist in target acquisition to increase the precision of ground-based systems. Drones have also become consumable like bullets or artillery shells, deployed with the aim to disturb and exhaust, not merely to destroy. The overall effect of drone intelligence and strikes contributes to reducing the number of shells needed, lowering the logistical burden, and increasing the pace of artillery fires.\nThe war in Ukraine has shown a drone script that differs from the main preoccupations of the security studies community. The remote and precision warfare narrative painted an incomplete picture. Instead of advanced million-dollar large drones that formed the basis of the theoretical literature, small, low-tech drones of commercial origins are changing dynamics on the battlefields of Ukraine."

      "question_context": "Analyzing documented Ukrainian long-range UAV operations with supporting statistics and source-based description directly links the thesis to evidence of technological innovation and operational impact.",
      "answer": "Ukraine\u2019s adoption of long-range UAVs has enabled cross-border operations by utilizing innovative tactics such as smuggling drones into Russian territory within disguised civilian vehicles like cargo trucks and mobile wooden homes, from which the drones are launched silently and remotely operated with visual feeds and GPS guidance. This approach allowed Ukraine to launch coordinated strikes deep inside Russia, targeting strategic airfields and damaging significant military assets including Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 long-range bombers and A-50 early warning aircraft vital to Russia\u2019s command-and-control capabilities[1][2]. Such operations, notably Operation Spider\u2019s Web, demonstrated that long-range UAVs can overcome traditional air defense and electronic warfare (EW) measures by exploiting factors like launching from inside enemy territory and employing AI-based visual recognition systems integrated with GPS navigation to maintain strike accuracy even under GPS-jamming conditions[1][3][2].\n\nThe operational impact of these UAV missions is well documented: Ukraine claimed to have destroyed or damaged numerous Russian aircraft, including a third of Russia\u2019s strategic cruise missile bombers, impairing Russia\u2019s capacity to sustain missile attacks on Ukrainian targets[1][2]. Additionally, Ukrainian long-range drones have targeted Russian industrial and military infrastructure beyond direct frontline combat zones, including oil refineries, chemical plants, and military facilities even in remote regions like Chechnya, thereby disrupting logistical and operational capabilities[2][4]. These strikes caused temporary shutdowns of significant portions of Russia\u2019s refining capacity, leading to fuel price spikes and export halts, underscoring the strategic-level effects of sustained UAV attacks[4].\n\nFrom a technological perspective, Ukraine\u2019s long-range drones face typical trade-offs including reduced warhead size due to payload and fuel constraints, slower speeds compared to missiles, and vulnerability to air defenses. Nevertheless, the drones\u2019 modular design, adaptability, and the use of swarm tactics involving strike vehicles combined with decoys complicate air defense responses and increase mission success rates. For instance, reported sorties have included up to 100 drones with around 30% serving as diversionary units, synchronously entering defended airspace to overwhelm Russian defenses[5][6]. Ukraine\u2019s domestic production of these drones, supported by Western funding and open-source innovation, enables scaling up to hundreds of units monthly, contributing to a persistent and scalable UAV campaign[1][5][6].\n\nThe cost-effectiveness of these UAV systems is emphasized by the substantial damage inflicted at comparatively low unit costs; FPV drones cost only a few thousand dollars each yet have caused billions of dollars in damage to high-value Russian targets[1][7]. This economic efficiency represents a shift in military logistics and doctrine, highlighting the viability of UAV swarms as affordable precision-strike assets. Ukraine\u2019s efforts to develop inexpensive kinetic countermeasures against enemy drones\u2014such as Shrike FPV interceptors costing between $300 and $500, robotic air defense modules armed with machine guns, and prototype reusable interceptor drones\u2014illustrate their strategic orientation towards cost-effective force multiplication and defense sustainability[3][6].\n\nOverall, Ukraine\u2019s integration of long-range UAVs into military operations has enabled precise, cost-effective cross-border strikes that degrade key enemy capabilities and infrastructure. The documented outcomes, including destruction of critical Russian air assets, disruption of logistics and industrial capacities, and demonstration of advanced drone swarm and AI navigation tactics, substantiate the thesis that these UAV operations represent a technologically innovative and economically advantageous form of modern precision warfare[1][3][5][4][6][7].",

            "Among the most significant targets were the Tu-95 and Tu-22M3 long-range strategic bombers. These aircraft have been central to Russia\u2019s campaign of missile attacks on Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, often launching from well beyond Ukraine\u2019s defensive reach. The A-50 early warning aircraft, also struck in this operation, are integral to Russia\u2019s airborne command-and-control structure, helping to coordinate fighter jet movements and detect Ukrainian air defenses.\nWhat made this operation truly remarkable was the means of delivery. Ukraine used 117 FPV drones\u2014typically associated with short-range tactical engagements\u2014and repurposed them for strategic effect. These drones were not launched from Ukrainian soil but from within Russian territory itself. Months of clandestine preparation allowed the SBU and military collaborators to smuggle drones and launch equipment across the border. The payloads were hidden inside civilian-looking vehicles such as cargo trucks and mobile wooden homes that were strategically stationed near the bases.\nEach truck was equipped with a remote-control system, including retractable roofs that allowed the drones to be launched silently and discreetly. Once the drones were airborne, operators used visual feeds and likely GPS assistance to guide them to their targets. The drones attacked nearly simultaneously across vast distances, causing widespread confusion and overwhelming any coordinated Russian defense.\nNotably, Ukrainian operatives who had set up the launch zones were exfiltrated before the strike commenced, a detail that underscores the operation\u2019s intelligence sophistication and high-level coordination. The ability to not only stage and launch such an operation but to do so while extracting the personnel involved demonstrates a level of operational maturity that few nations possess.",
            "Visual-based AI systems, integrated with GPS navigation, allowed these drones to operate effectively even in electronic warfare environments. Russia has invested heavily in GPS-jamming and signal disruption technologies. Yet, by launching from within Russian territory and using AI-based target recognition, Ukrainian drones were able to evade these defenses. Real-time image processing and adaptive flight correction systems enhanced their strike accuracy, even in adverse conditions.\nMoreover, the logistical component of the operation revealed another layer of technological sophistication. The drones were concealed in specially modified civilian trucks, disguised as mobile homes or commercial cargo. These vehicles were equipped with retractable launch platforms and onboard communication systems, allowing remote activation. This hybrid model of warfare\u2014blending stealth logistics, AI, and mobile strike capability\u2014represents a departure from traditional military doctrines centered on large, centralized platforms.\nThe drones (not to scale) were launched from kit homes loaded onto trucks\nImportantly, the low cost of FPV drones compared to the high-value targets they destroyed points to a major shift in the economics of warfare. With units costing as little as a few thousand dollars, Ukraine was able to inflict billions in damages. This cost-effectiveness makes drone swarms an attractive option for other nations and non-state actors alike, potentially triggering a global shift in procurement priorities and military doctrine.\nUkraine\u2019s growing domestic capacity to produce and adapt these drones\u2014supported by Western funding and open-source innovation\u2014suggests that the country is on the frontier of military technology. This operation was not just a tactical success but a demonstration of Ukraine\u2019s ability to develop, deploy, and iterate on battlefield technologies in real time."

First, their speed is typically only 150\u2013400 km/h, many times slower than ballistic missiles and two to three times slower than cruise missiles. Second, their warheads are relatively small because more space must be reserved for fuel to cover vast distances.

            "The study of drones in interstate war is rapidly evolving. Much of the existing scholarship focuses on the impact of a few types of drones, despite growth in new types. Such scholarship also makes assumptions that drones can be shot down with ease. This approach limits our understanding of their strategic value. Marcel Plichta analyses Ukraine\u2019s use of one-way attack drones to target Russian military and industrial facilities between June 2022 and January 2025. The study finds that Ukraine\u2019s one-way attack drones imposed severe costs on Russia, despite their vulnerability to air defence. The findings call for further research into the utility of drones and drone countermeasures in interstate wars.\u25fc\nFew military developments in the Russo-Ukrainian war receive as much public and academic attention as drones. However, comparatively little scholarly attention has been given to the long-range one-way attack (OWA) drones that Russia and Ukraine use to strike deep in each other\u2019s territory. This article discusses Ukraine\u2019s use of OWA drones to strike targets in Russia. It begins by outlining the state of strategic studies scholarship on drones, and provides an assessment of Ukraine\u2019s OWA drone campaign from mid-2022 to early 2025. The number of successful strikes shows that relatively inexpensive standoff platforms can challenge states\u2019 air defence assets and have a strategic impact on the defender.",
            "Ukraine\u2019s use of long-range OWA drones against Russia is worthy of scholarly attention for two reasons. First, this conflict features an enormous number of OWA drones. Long-range OWA drones are used in conflicts in Yemen, Israel and Iraq, but their use is an order of magnitude higher in Ukraine and Russia. In September 2024, the Ukrainian government claimed that Russia had launched over 8,000 OWA drones at the country since the start of the conflict. Ukrainian OWA drone use is likely lower but still dwarfs drone use by actors such as the Houthis in similar timeframes.\nSecond, Ukraine\u2019s development of an OWA drone fleet has implications for proliferating precise mass. Ukraine has concurrent drone and missile programmes, but, to date, Kyiv has been able to manufacture many more OWA drones than missiles. The effectiveness of its drone campaign is consequential for minor powers and non-state actors, who may be able to produce or acquire OWA drones more easily than traditional missiles. Ukraine and Russia are arms exporters in peacetime and could well end up selling their OWA drones abroad if buyers see a strategic benefit to acquiring a modest standoff capability.\nOf course, the lower cost of most OWA drones compared with other standoff systems comes with trade-offs. OWA drones tend to have smaller warheads and fly slower than a cruise or ballistic missile. Strategic studies scholars are correct that current drones are vulnerable to air defence systems. Many OWA drones also use global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) \u2013 such as GPS or GLONASS \u2013 to reach their targets, which make them vulnerable to electronic warfare (EW) systems that jam or spoof GNSS. This has led to a cycle of innovation and counter-innovation whereby users of drones and drone countermeasures adapt to each other\u2019s new techniques and methods, pushing up the costs of drones.",
            "After spending 2022 and 2023 developing the capability to launch a sustained OWA drone campaign, Ukraine has dramatically escalated operations since 2024. In early 2024, Ukraine launched a large series of strikes on Russian oil infrastructure. By April, the US government claimed that the strikes temporarily halted approximately 14% of Russia\u2019s refining capacity, caused a halt in exports and caused fuel price spikes in Russia. The crisis led the US government to publicly disavow Ukrainian drone attacks and reportedly privately pressure Kyiv to cease attacks. While Ukraine never fully halted attacks on oil infrastructure, it returned to striking a wider variety of targets until January 2025. These included industrial targets such as chemical plants and military facilities in previously untouched regions such as Chechnya. In May 2024, Ukrainian drones attacked a Russian long-range radar installation, demonstrating the range of expensive targets within Russia that are under threat.\nUkraine improved its OWA drone campaign by scaling up drone production with external assistance as well as technological advancements. Ukrainian drones likely use GNSS as an inexpensive way to navigate hundreds of kilometres autonomously, but using it risks interception by Russian EW. In August 2024, several news outlets reported that Ukraine was using terrain mapping, whereby the OWA drone uses machine learning to understand its position from the geography surrounding it. Leveraging machine learning is more complex than using pre-existing satellite navigation, but it is substantially harder for Russia to use EW to locate or defeat OWA drones using it, and demonstrates that modular improvements can challenge air defence assumptions."

            "Further drone adaptations may render traditional EW and air defense countermeasures ineffective on the battlefield. Ukrainian EW systems are becoming less effective against new EW-resistant or medium range drones, although EW systems are unlikely to become completely obsolete due to the likelihood that radio-controlled FPV drones will remain in large numbers on the battlefield because of their simplicity and low cost. Beskresnov observed that the effectiveness of Ukrainian EW systems mounted on trucks is decreasing because Russian FPV drones are operating on a wider range of frequencies, which makes it challenging for Ukrainian forces to defeat them.[70] Beskrestnov reported that Ukrainian forces do not have enough stationary EW systems to protect all rear areas to a depth of 30 to 40 kilometers and need additional systems to protect against EW-resistant fiber optic UAVs.[71] Traditional air defense countermeasures may be insufficient to resist tactical UAVs en masse, as they are scarce and expensive to operate and scale. Ukraine\u2019s Unmanned Systems Forces (USF) reported that traditional air defense missiles can cost up to one million dollars, for example.[72] Ukrainian mobile fire groups may also have a more challenging time shooting down tactical drones that are flying beyond the frontlines, at higher altitudes, or hibernating until activation.",
            "Ukraine can prevent Russian forces from achieving the limited effects of BAI by urgently developing tactical kinetic anti-drone systems. Ukrainian developers urgently need to develop a variety of new and inexpensive kinetic countermeasures, both for long-range Shahed and tactical UAVs on the battlefield and in the near rear. Ukrainian developers have fielded some tactical UAV interceptors, such as Shrike FPV interceptors that cost $300 to $500 and can target Russian reconnaissance and strike UAVs.[73] Ukrainian forces notably posted footage in April 2025 reportedly showing Shrike interceptors targeting Russian Supercam and Merlin reconnaissance drones.[74] Ukrainian developers recently tested robotic air defense modules, which can be fitted with machine guns and are designed to engage low-flying and slow-moving aerial targets.[75] Ukrainian forces are also reportedly planning to start using prototypes of reusable interceptor drones that fire projectiles at Russian UAVs to lower costs and offset shortages of drone interceptor production.[76]\nUkraine will also need to continue to develop EW systems and countermeasures to suppress radio-controlled FPV UAVs that are still present in large numbers on the frontlines. Beskretnov observed that radio-controlled UAVs still dominate \u201cin percentage terms,\u201d and Russia will likely continue to use these drones in combination with more advanced FPV UAVs and loitering munitions out of cost efficiency.[77] Ukraine will need to develop new EW capabilities that are able to suppress UAVs at greater distances.",

Ukraine and its partners must invest urgently in kinetic anti-drone systems that are not reliant on EW to secure near-rear areas and, ultimately, frontline positions as well."

            "Russian forces are actively achieving some effects of battlefield air interdiction (BAI) of Ukrainian ground lines of communication (GLOCs) with tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. BAI is the use of air power to strike targets in the near rear of the frontline to impact battlefield operations in the near term.[3] These operationally significant targets include roads, railways, and bridges (infrastructure that supports GLOCs); command posts; ammunition depots; assembly areas; and training grounds. In simple terms, BAI aims to deny the adversary the use of crucial logistics lines and facilities necessary to sustain battlefield operations. Ukrainian servicemen and analysts reported that Russian forces began to systematically target Ukrainian GLOCs and other operationally significant targets with tactical first-person-view (FPV) UAVs and loitering munitions across the entire frontline as early as Winter and Spring 2025, effectively using these UAVs to interdict Ukrainian logistics ahead of the Russian Summer 2025 offensive.[4] Ukrainian sources noted that Russian forces previously only operated tactical UAVs on the battlefield, but that they have adapted these UAVs to strike Ukraine\u2019s near rear areas.[5] Russian forces recently made notable advances in the Lyman, Siversk, Kostyantynivka, Pokrovsk, and Novopavlivka directions, likely after achieving limited BAI effects with new FPV drone and loitering munitions adaptations.",
            "Neither Ukraine nor Russia has previously been able to conduct BAI using manned aircraft or UAVs due to the density and sophistication of adversary air defenses and electronic warfare (EW) over the past three years.[6] Russia has largely used its aircraft to launch long-range missile strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure in the deep rear and to launch glide bombs along the frontline, but has not used aircraft directly over the battlefield. Ukraine has shown that it is possible to conduct at least partial BAI using ground-based systems during the 2022 Kherson counteroffensive when Ukrainian forces used US-provided HIMARS to deprive Russian forces of the use of the Antonivsky Bridge and the roadway over Kakhovka Dam.[7] Neither Ukrainian nor Russian UAVs can fully accomplish BAI effects such as destroying a bridge or a highway due to payload limitations. UAVs, however, are increasingly targeting individual vehicles on the GLOCs, defensive positions such as trenches, and infrastructure targets that are accomplishing interdiction effects similar to those that BAI aims to achieve. These interdiction effects include keeping adversary reinforcements and supplies from arriving at the frontlines in a timely manner.",

            "3. The current deployment of AI is partial in scope, enhancing certain functions and addressing some operational challenges rather than enabling full system autonomy. AI is a foundational technology for transitioning from automated to autonomous systems, or systems that can decide how to achieve a goal rather than merely execute human-programmed algorithms. AI significantly enhances specific functions, such as drone footage analysis and target recognition, target tracking, and autonomous navigation, including last-mile navigation and sound and text analysis for intelligence extraction, where AI replaces 99 percent of human labor. While such systems may operate without direct human control, they typically do not perform the entire process of finding, selecting, and engaging targets independently.\n  4. Ukrainian forces have widely adopted small and medium first-person-view (FPV) drones as platforms that may be quickly adapted for diverse missions through modular design and interchangeable equipment. Unlike the United States, Ukraine categorizes drones based on structural configuration, payload capacity, and propeller diameter. Initially, 7 inch FPV drones were common due to their ease of assembly, but growing operational demands have shifted preferences toward 9\u201310 inch quadcopters capable of carrying heavier payloads and achieving longer ranges. Adding an improvised explosive device (IED), an IED release mechanism, various sensors, or signal relaying equipment to the same FPV platform can transform it into a kamikaze drone; a bomber; an intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) system; or a relay node. This modular approach, which allows for quick adaptation to diverse missions by swapping components, makes FPV drones a flexible and scalable asset on the front line.",
            "This tactical air-land operation successfully destroyed Russian positions and showcased Ukraine\u2019s innovative approach to offset manpower limitations by leveraging attritable technologies. Although described as a \u201c\u201d in conflict evolution, the robotic systems were still manually (though remotely) operated. Nevertheless, the operation brings Ukraine one step closer to implementing its vision of the future battlefield, which will increasingly utilize AI-enabled autonomous capabilities.\nCSIS conversations with Ukrainian warfighters and defense manufacturers reveal the organic approach that Ukraine and its domestic industry are taking toward achieving autonomy on the battlefield. Rather than follow a formal strategy, this process has evolved in response to several influences, including competitive pressures from the adversary, market dynamics, geopolitical considerations, and foreign export controls, especially China\u2019s of key drone and microelectronic components to Ukraine.\nThe technological evolution driving this transition may be divided into three key trends progressing in parallel. These trends result in systems that are not only flexible, cost-effective, and highly efficient but also adaptable to diverse mission requirements and equipped with AI-powered software that enables autonomy.\n_Trend 1: Ukrainian forces have widely adopted small FPV drones as a platform that can be quickly adapted for diverse missions through modular design._\nSmall and medium Ukrainian-built FPV drones are the most commonly used platforms on the Ukrainian battlefield, aside from consumer off-the-shelf models like the Chinese-made DJI Mavic. While Ukrainian forces use these commercial drones, they cannot directly influence Mavic\u2019s technology development. In contrast, local innovators produce and refine many FPV drones, making them the focus of this analysis."

And recently, Zelensky offered a \u201cmega deal\u201d to share Ukraine\u2019s drone technology and bring the US up to speed, in exchange for US weapons.\nSo what accounts for the unexpected impact of Ukraine\u2019s drone use? The data indicates that while drones are often easy to shoot down, large numbers of long-range OWA drones attacking multiple targets are tricky to stop. This is because Russia needs to guess where Ukraine will attack and place defenses accordingly.\nRussia has lots of air defense systems, but it is also the largest country on earth and cannot defend everything at once. The need to pick and choose what areas of the country to defend and which to creates an air defense dilemma for Russia that Ukraine has exploited.\nMy findings that an OWA drone campaign can impose serious costs on defenders like Russia are consequential for how other countries should organise their air defenses. As the case of Ukraine shows, the fact that these drones long-range and relative precision means that attackers can target lots of different sites across the country and take circuitous paths around air defense to get there. \nThese factors make it difficult for to anticipate where the next attack will come from and take action in time.\nThis is a global problem. The relative ease of manufacturing, procuring and proliferating OWA drones, compared to a missile, means that many states and terror groups could acquire the ability to launch long-range attacks much more easily than a few years ago."

            "From a technological warfare perspective, ComplexDiscovery has highlighted the evolution of unmanned systems in modern conflicts, and Ukraine\u2019s actions in this regard reflect this trajectory. These strikes not only degrade Russian logistics and ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) capacity but signal Ukraine\u2019s maturing ability to integrate ISR with kinetic effects at strategic depth.

These civilians, many of whom had resisted Russification campaigns, were reportedly held for months in unsanitary conditions. As ComplexDiscovery has frequently noted, such forced deportations could bear significant implications under international humanitarian law\u2014potentially constituting violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention.

      "question_context": "This question fills the gap regarding the broader strategic impact and how the conflict\u2019s drone warfare is affecting neighboring military policies and doctrines, supported by citations.",
      "answer": "Published analyses and expert assessments indicate that the extensive adoption of drone warfare in the Russia-Ukraine conflict is significantly influencing and reshaping regional security doctrines across Eastern Europe. The intense and innovative use of drones by both Russia and Ukraine is driving rapid changes in military thought, operational strategies, and defense procurement policies across NATO and neighboring states.\n\nThe Ukraine conflict demonstrated how drones have evolved from emerging technologies to decisive battlefield assets, altering the pace and conduct of warfare. Ukraine\u2019s rapid indigenization and mass production of drones, producing millions annually, have contributed to persistent aerial surveillance, strike capabilities, and a protective \u201cdrone wall\u201d defense system that compensates for manpower shortfalls and prevents enemy advances. This system\u2019s effectiveness has led to drones inflicting approximately 70 to 80 percent of casualties on both sides, highlighting their centrality to Ukraine\u2019s defensive and offensive operations[1][2][3][4].\n\nThis drone-centric warfare has prompted significant shifts in military doctrine beyond Ukraine. NATO\u2019s strategic posture is adapting to improve drone production capacity, counter-drone technologies, and integrated defense networks to maintain technological advantage and resilience against Russian drone offensives, which often combine electronic warfare with kinetic countermeasures. Such adaptations emphasize a \u201clayered defense\u201d approach incorporating signals intelligence, jamming, and kinetic interception to counter the increasing saturation attacks of low-cost drones like the Iranian-derived Shahed series used by Russia[1][5][6].\n\nFurthermore, Russian drone incursions into the airspace of NATO countries such as Poland and Romania have triggered heightened concerns about escalation risks and forced NATO to reconsider air defense readiness and protocols. Such drone flights are widely interpreted as deliberate provocations designed to test NATO\u2019s political will and military responses, influencing Eastern European defense policies to prioritize airspace security and anti-drone capabilities. Ukraine\u2019s experience and institutional knowledge in counter-drone operations have become crucial resources, with offers from Ukrainian officials to train neighboring countries\u2019 forces, further integrating drone expertise into regional security frameworks[7][8].\n\nAt a broader strategic level, experts stress that the Russia-Ukraine conflict serves as a critical innovation hub, accelerating the evolution of drone tactics and technologies and thereby informing how militaries in the region prepare for future conflicts. This transformation encompasses not only state actors but also violent extremist organizations that may adopt swarm tactics, FPV (first-person view) drones, and advanced countermeasures observed in Ukraine\u2019s battlefields, highlighting a wider security impact[9][10].\n\nIn response, European and NATO states are advocating for integrated defense markets inclusive of Ukraine\u2019s defense tech sector, to scale production and innovation of drones and anti-drone technologies. Strengthening Ukraine as a drone superpower is framed as a strategic investment underpinning European long-term security and deterrence capabilities in a drone-dominant future[3].\n\nThese analyses collectively emphasize that the widespread, multifaceted employment of drones in the Russia-Ukraine warfare is reshaping Eastern European military doctrines by underscoring the necessity of integrated drone warfare capabilities, counter-drone systems, and adaptive air defense strategies within regional security policies[1][3][5][7][9].\n\nReferences:  \n[1] understandingwar.org \u2013 analysis of UAV and counter-drone tactical adaptations by Russia and Ukraine, impact on doctrine and allied responses  \n[2] atlanticcouncil.org \u2013 Ukraine\u2019s drone production scale, battlefield effectiveness, and NATO\u2019s doctrinal implications  \n[3] atlasinstitute.org \u2013 detailed discussion on NATO\u2019s evolving drone response and the conflict\u2019s reshaping of military doctrine  \n[4] cepa.org \u2013 practical implementation of Ukraine\u2019s \u201cdrone wall\u201d concept and its strategic defense implications  \n[5] csis.org \u2013 layered defense approach in countering drone saturation attacks, incorporating kinetic and electronic warfare  \n[6] www.trtworld.com \u2013 political and military assessments of Russian drone incursions into NATO airspace and allied responses  \n[7] understandingwar.org \u2013 Ukrainian offers to train NATO members in counter-drone tactics following provocations in NATO airspace  \n[8] ctc.westpoint.edu \u2013 drone warfare innovation hub role of the conflict and its influence on extremist and regional actors  \n[9] www.csis.org \u2013 assessment of drone warfare evolving the sixth-generation warfare concept involving integrated multi-domain operations  \n[10] www.tandfonline.com \u2013 changing military perceptions of drones and their expanding role in combined arms combat across the region",

            "The West should continue to invest in Ukrainian anti-drone innovations, as the United States and its allies may face similar modern warfare dilemmas in the near future. The PRC is seemingly intensifying its covert support of the Russian UAV and counter-drone systems production efforts and is likely learning valuable technological and tactical lessons to accommodate Russian parts and equipment orders. The adversary entente of Russia, the PRC, North Korea, and Iran may use these lessons in future wars against the United States or its allies.\nRussia\u2019s current technological advantage on the frontlines is concerning, but it can likely be made fleeting. Ukraine\u2019s ability to adapt, develop new countermeasures, and innovate existing technologies and tactics is one of the key rate determiners of Russia\u2019s ability to sustain efforts to achieve some effects of BAI that have been facilitating Russian advances in Spring and Summer 2025.\n*Ukrainian military analysts describe the \u201ckill zone\u201d as an area of elevated drone strike risk, in contrast to the US doctrine, which describes the \u201ckill zone\u201d as an area in which drones can strike any equipment or personnel that enters the area. Ukrainian military analysts argue that both Russian and Ukrainian forces continue to operate in these drone \u201ckill zones\u201d for extended periods of time, where they are exposed to elevated drone strike risks but are not always hit with drone strikes upon entering or operating in the area.",

Russian UAV adaptations are likely achieving some effects of battlefield air interdiction (BAI): The use of airpower to strike targets in the near rear of the frontline to impact battlefield operations in the near term.[1] Neither Ukraine nor Russia has been able to conduct BAI using manned aircraft or UAVs due to the density and sophistication of adversary air defenses and electronic warfare (EW) over the past three years, but Russian forces are now achieving partial BAI effects in support of their offensives.[2] Russia\u2019s allies, especially the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), have enabled Russia to develop and scale the production of UAVs that are more resistant to EW interference and capable of operating at longer distances, higher speeds, and in challenging environments. Ukraine and its partners must invest urgently in kinetic anti-drone systems that are not reliant on EW to secure near-rear areas and, ultimately, frontline positions as well."

            "Given this well-documented pattern, the Russo-Ukrainian War is likely to serve as the next major catalyst, disrupting the current evolutionary plateau in terrorist drone use. As violent extremist organizations adapt and repurpose drone innovations emerging from the conflict, the world may soon witness a new era of asymmetric warfare characterized by the widespread use of swarm tactics, FPV drone strikes, and advanced drone countermeasures. These techniques, initially developed for state-led combat, will likely be integrated into the arsenals of extremist groups.\nFurthermore, recent reports suggest formal bi-directional exchanges of drone warfare tactics between state and non-state actors, particularly involving Russian and Ukrainian advisors collaborating with various groups. Following Hamas\u2019 October 2023 attack on Israel, Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief, suggested that Hamas\u2019 sophisticated drone operations closely mirrored tactics used by Russian forces in Ukraine, implying potential Russian training or Hamas learning from drone activity from that conflict. Conversely, in late 2024, reports emerged that Ukrainian intelligence operatives supplied approximately 150 FPV drones and deployed around 20 experienced drone operators to assist HTS. This support aimed to enhance HTS\u2019 drone capabilities against forces of the Russia-allied Assad regime.\nPart II: Introducing the VEO Drone Capability-Impact Framework The Russo-Ukrainian War has already triggered rapid evolutionary shifts in drone warfare for both Ukraine and Russia. This transformation will have lasting implications\u2014not only shaping how both states leverage drone technology in future conflicts but also providing a blueprint for how VEOs might operationalize drones."

            "In parallel, the EU should rapidly establish a unified defense market that includes Ukraine. This means integrating Kyiv into the European innovation ecosystem and fostering collaboration between Western industry and Ukraine\u2019s vibrant defense tech ecosystem. Ukrainian drone producers would gain from European orders and investments, while the EU would benefit from Ukraine\u2019s battle-tested technologies, production capacity, and agile innovation mindset. Strengthening Ukraine as an allied drone superpower is clearly a strategic investment in the continent\u2019s long-term security.\nHistory shows that transformative technologies define entire eras of warfare. Artillery was the decisive weapon during World War I, while tanks, combined with air power, ruled the battlefield a generation later in World War II. The 1991 Gulf War marked the next leap: The ascendancy of precision-guided air power.\nToday, the dominance of drones is rewriting military doctrine and looks set to shape conflicts for years to come. Ukraine has the technology, talent, and industrial potential to prevail in the war with Russia, but currently lacks the funding to scale drone production to the necessary levels.\nFailure to act now will prolong the war in Ukraine, erode Western security, and embolden autocrats worldwide. The stakes have never been higher; the solution has rarely been clearer. The young Ukrainian drone operators in that dimly lit command room understand this very well. Ukraine\u2019s Western partners must now also grasp the new military realities.

            "# Rethinking NATO\u2019s Defence in the Drone Era\n_How the rapid evolution of drone warfare in the Russia-Ukraine conflict is reshaping military doctrine, highlighting NATO\u2019s vulnerabilities and the need for adaptations in a drone dominant future._\nThe Russia-Ukraine war fundamentally reshaped modern warfare. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS), drones, have gone from emerging technology to crucial assets on the battlefield (Jakes, L., Santora, M., Kramer, A. E., Hernandez, M. and Sholudko, L., 2025). Their sudden ascent altered the pace, cost, and conduct of warfare, offering valuable lessons on the future of military operations (Bronk, J., 2025). To ensure credible deterrence against future threats, NATO must fully understand the impact of modern drone warfare and adjust its strategic posture accordingly (Jakes, L., 2025). Yet, experts caution that, while drones will represent a key asset, they are unlikely to replace traditional military power (Bronk, J., 2025).\n#### The Ascendancy of Drones in Ukraine\nSince 2022, the drone industry has grown rapidly, becoming essential to Ukraine\u2019s defence strategy (Halstian, M., 2025). Initially reliant on foreign drones and merely seven domestic manufacturers, Ukraine quickly indigenised production, building over two million FPV drones in 2024, and in February 2025, President Zelensky stated that Ukraine is now capable of producing 4 million drones annually (Finer, J. and Shimer, D., 2025).\nDrones have proven highly effective on the battlefield, with commanders attributing 70 to 80% of all Russian and Ukrainian casualties to their use (Jakes, L., Santora, M., Kramer, A. E., Hernandez, M. and Sholudko, L., 2025). Moreover, Ukraine managed to increase its success rate from 30% in 2022 to 70% in 2024 by compensating for reduced accuracy with a larger number of drones (Tian, N., Scarazzato, L. and Guiberteau Ricard, J., 2025).",
            "Ukraine\u2019s experience shows how drones shaped the current battlefield while still depending on integration with conventional firepower. For NATO, this highlights the need to increase drone production while still maintaining strong conventional capabilities and a balanced force posture. Current disparities in defence spending, counter-electronic warfare capabilities and procurement timelines could lead the Alliance to fall behind adversaries. Therefore, NATO\u2019s deterrence will depend on its ability to maintain strategic readiness, technological advantage and operational resilience as well as strong conventional capabilities.\n  1.

            "The Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to the first large-scale, high intensity war where both sides have extensively deployed military and commercial drones. What the conflict has so far highlighted is that the frequently mentioned \u201cgame-changing effect\u201d of drones on warfare depends on the game. Based on their category, drones produce distinctive military effects either as an extension of air power or as ammunition. Military thinking is therefore changing, making armed drones more politically acceptable. There is also reduced focus on the large armed and surveillance drones known from counterterrorism operations, as better integrated small drone scouts now serve land forces in combat. Far from being a mere security nuisance, small drones have yet to be effectively countered with air defenses. Military and dual-use export controls require adaptation to keep pace with these evolving battlefield realities. The drone lessons of the war in Ukraine thus point to many future challenges lying in wait for the international community.\nOn the final night of 2022, Ukrainian quadcopters buzzed over the frontline town of Bakhmut and dropped bomblets on Russian soldiers across the battlefield. With thermal imaging cameras that enabled them to identify targets in pitch black conditions, these small drones flew unspotted. Meanwhile, halfway across the country in the Kyiv Oblast, dozens of Russian loitering munitions struck Ukrainian energy facilities and apartment complexes, killing up to four and psychologically terrorizing the civilian population.",
            "Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine has also provided a testing ground for foreign drone powers, such as Turkey, the United States, and Iran, further accelerating drone proliferation. The war has meanwhile served as a public relations campaign for armed drones and loitering munitions, changing the public image of drones along the way. Drone operations in Ukraine contrast with the use of large drone systems in the war on terror over the past two decades, which became controversial due to their association with collateral damage and targeted killings beyond official battlefields.\nChanged perceptions of drone utility\u2014especially of small armed drones and drone scouts\u2014are likely to affect countries\u2019 future acquisitions. Indeed, the value of drone diversity in accomplishing military missions appears to be among the critical emerging technology lessons of this war. Adopting a comprehensive approach to drones that includes cost-efficient anti-drone defenses and uncrewed platforms across various domains will be an enduring lesson for militaries, policymakers, and industry.\nNATO classifies drones into three widely accepted main types based on their maximum take-off weight (NATO ): class I drones of less than 150 kilograms (kg) or about 331 pounds (lb), including small, mini, and micro drones; class II tactical drones of between 150 and 600 kg (331 and 1,323 lbs); and class III drones of greater than 600 kg. The drone dynamics in Ukraine have largely showcased class I and III systems. While large drones with missiles can be destructive under conditions of air superiority, small drones are proving crucial for battlespace awareness of infantry and maneuvering units. In addition, low-cost, one-way \u201ckamikaze\u201d attack drones offer yet another way to deliver explosives.\nFrom drones that fit in a backpack to model airplanes and those carrying lighter payloads (maximum 150 kg, but more commonly less than 10 kg), smaller drones have established their usefulness in Ukraine\u2019s contested airspace."

            "We have to discuss the impact of electronic warfare and counter-UAS technologies because, as I\u2019ve indicated, each development in this war gives an impetus and a necessary push for counter development. And so every significant advantage has a counter advantage. And electronic warfare has been very successful in going after adversarial drones with simple jamming and other types of interferences. But electronic warfare doesn\u2019t work successfully by itself. It has to work in a system. And so Russians are writing and practicing this whole kind of layered defense approach where signals intelligence tries to identify what kind of drones are in the area, followed by jamming and electronic warfare, of those drones that have been identified as adversarial, followed by physical protection and some kind of kinetic countermeasures against these drones. And they involve shotguns, rifles, physical protection, nets, physical barriers, and everything in between.\nCommunication is key in this war. And lack of communication results in drone fratricide. And this is an issue for both Russian and the Ukrainian militaries. Units that don\u2019t cooperate and don\u2019t necessarily inform each other usually end up shooting each other\u2019s UAVs. And so the statistics on drone losses actually are rather high, but they\u2019re also high because of lack of communication and this specific drone fratricide."

Zelensky also reaffirmed that Ukraine has offered to help train Polish forces to shoot down Russian drones.[14] Ukraine has developed invaluable tactics and technologies to effectively counter Russian drone strikes, and NATO states must work to absorb and institutionalize this experience the way Ukraine has in order to properly respond to potential Russian kinetic aggression against the alliance."

Specifically, European states and U.S. firms should work together to test new approaches to air defense that build on Ukrainian wartime innovations (e.g., acoustic sensors, an integrated air defense network, and improvised surface-to-air missiles) and emerging approaches that use electronic warfare and even high-energy lasers. Second, the U.S. military should catalogue these efforts and use them to accelerate its own thinking about layered air defense in future conflicts, which will almost certainly see a mix of cruise missiles and ballistic missiles attacking alongside waves of one-way attack drones. In these fights, point airfield defense and mobile counter\u2013unmanned aircraft systems will not be enough to counter drone saturation designed to break air defense systems and open attack lanes for more exquisite weapons.\nThis brief proceeds by analyzing Shahed attack trends during the Ukraine war. Understanding these trends highlights three policy options for both helping defend Ukraine and reducing the ability of Russia\u2019s punishment strategy with low-cost drone attacks:\n  * Testing and fielding new high-energy lasers to add an additional layer to Ukraine\u2019s air defense network."

            "Abstract: _This article analyzes the evolution of terrorist drone usage and forecasts its future trajectory in light of the tactical and technological innovations emerging from the Russo-Ukrainian War. The conflict has become a critical \u201cinnovation hub\u201d for drone warfare, accelerating advancements in the scale, speed, and range of drone operations. These developments are not only transforming the modern battlefield but also creating new opportunities for violent extremist organizations (VEOs) to enhance their operational impact and engage in surprise. This, it is argued, will lead to a new burst of terror drone activity across key threat vectors. In particular, the war has normalized large-scale drone deployment, demonstrating the feasibility of launching coordinated drone swarms and phased attacks capable of overwhelming existing defenses. Likewise, the widespread use of high-speed First-Person View (FPV) drones in Ukraine highlights the tactical value of speed and agility\u2014capabilities that are increasingly within reach for terrorist actors. When paired with emerging technologies such as AI-assisted targeting, these systems could significantly increase the precision and impact of future attacks. The article also emphasizes the growing threat of long-range drone operations. To help contextualize these shifts, the article introduces the VEO Drone Capability-Impact Framework, which illustrates how both component- and system-level advances continue to lower the barriers to entry for extremist actors. The convergence of drone warfare with other disruptive technologies\u2014such as additive manufacturing and artificial intelligence\u2014is also explored, as the fusion of these capabilities creates even more opportunities for extremists to be creative and to innovate with drones in the future",
            "The Russo-Ukrainian War has emerged as an innovation hub. While \u201cevery war offers a window into how future wars will be waged,\u201d the case of Ukraine stands apart as particularly unique. The conflict has revolutionized the role and scope of drone warfare and the operational use of artificial intelligence, pushing the boundaries of applied warfare in human-machine teaming. In addition, the sourcing of materiel inputs for the war has involved a combination of state-level assistance and the widespread, scaled, and innovative use of commercially available systems and components. This ranges from the deployment of thousands of DJI drones to the critical integration of commercial components in state-produced systems, such as Iran\u2019s Shahed drones. The war has also been unique due to the diverse mix and convergence of actors who are supporting the two warring parties. General Bryan Fenton, the leader of U.S. Special Operations Command, recently noted that the conflict exemplifies a form of adversarial convergence: \u201cThis is not just Russia fighting Ukraine \u2026 It\u2019s Russia, backed by Iranian drones, North Korean personnel and indirect Chinese contributions.\u201d Faced with these developments, the United States and its allies are closely monitoring the innovations and advancements resulting from the war. Many of these innovations are not only worth emulating but may also pose challenges that Western forces will need to contend with in the future. However, other actors, including violent extremist organizations (VEOs), are also observing these developments, and it is likely that they will inspire new terror drone tactics and strategies.",
            "Given this well-documented pattern, the Russo-Ukrainian War is likely to serve as the next major catalyst, disrupting the current evolutionary plateau in terrorist drone use. As violent extremist organizations adapt and repurpose drone innovations emerging from the conflict, the world may soon witness a new era of asymmetric warfare characterized by the widespread use of swarm tactics, FPV drone strikes, and advanced drone countermeasures. These techniques, initially developed for state-led combat, will likely be integrated into the arsenals of extremist groups.\nFurthermore, recent reports suggest formal bi-directional exchanges of drone warfare tactics between state and non-state actors, particularly involving Russian and Ukrainian advisors collaborating with various groups. Following Hamas\u2019 October 2023 attack on Israel, Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine\u2019s military intelligence chief, suggested that Hamas\u2019 sophisticated drone operations closely mirrored tactics used by Russian forces in Ukraine, implying potential Russian training or Hamas learning from drone activity from that conflict. Conversely, in late 2024, reports emerged that Ukrainian intelligence operatives supplied approximately 150 FPV drones and deployed around 20 experienced drone operators to assist HTS. This support aimed to enhance HTS\u2019 drone capabilities against forces of the Russia-allied Assad regime.\nPart II: Introducing the VEO Drone Capability-Impact Framework The Russo-Ukrainian War has already triggered rapid evolutionary shifts in drone warfare for both Ukraine and Russia. This transformation will have lasting implications\u2014not only shaping how both states leverage drone technology in future conflicts but also providing a blueprint for how VEOs might operationalize drones."

            "How to stop it? Tech is a large part of the answer, and drones in particular. According to General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, the former armed forces commander who is now Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to the UK, his country must think about \u201ca high-tech war for survival.\u201d In a , he said this will use \u201ca minimum of human resources and a minimum of economically cheap means to achieve maximum effect.\u201d\nDrones have become central to Kyiv\u2019s battlefield strategy, not only for surveillance and strikes, but to hold the line, stop Russia\u2019s advance, and substitute for soldiers it doesn\u2019t have.\nWhat is emerging is a new kind of layered defense, which Ukrainian officials call a \u201c\u201d and some analysts refer to as a \u201cdrone wall:\u201d a continuous defensive corridor of drones along Ukraine\u2019s most vulnerable positions.\nUkrainian forces now use drones for everything from reconnaissance and strike missions to logistics, evacuation, and mine-laying. In some areas, they\u2019ve become a substitute for infantry altogether.\n\u201cThe frontline is fragmented,\u201d said Muzyka, \u201cthere aren\u2019t enough soldiers to man their defensive positions, so they use drones.\u201d\nFirst-person view (FPV) drones are launched at a scale unseen anywhere else in modern conflict, often by small units operating close to the line of contact. Their aim isn\u2019t just to harass Russian troops, but to delay and disrupt advances long enough for Ukrainian forces to reposition or counterattack.\nBut their impact should be seen for what it is. They are tactical enablers in war, not a complete overhaul of military strategy, according to Mathieu Boul\u00e8gue, a Senior Fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA).\n\u201cYou don\u2019t win a war with drones, but you can definitely help achieve battlefield victory with the use of drones and the long-term planning on how you use them,\u201d he said. Commanders can also, as Ukraine demonstrated in attacks against Russian military airfields on June 1, do",
            "According to Watling, Russia\u2019s offensive momentum picked up in late 2024. But \u201cadvances then stalled as Ukraine adapted to Russian assault tactics and imposed [the] deep belt of attrition that prevented Russian troops reaching the line of contact in sufficient numbers to break through.\u201d\nThe drone wall is the technological backbone of this belt, offering persistent aerial surveillance, strike capability, and protective cover for Ukraine\u2019s overstretched infantry. The kill zone is not a fixed structure, but a dense network of FPVs, interceptors, and jammers.\nUnmanned weapons now inflict about 70% of all casualties in the war on both sides, [according to the Ukrainian military](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/28/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-drones.html) \u2014 more than all other weapons combined.\nThe drone wall has reshaped Ukraine\u2019s defense and how modern warfare is fought, but it hasn\u2019t solved the war\u2019s underlying imbalance. In theory, the system gives commanders time to respond: to deploy artillery, anti-tank teams, or drone swarms against approaching Russian forces. In practice, gaps still remain.\nSign up to recieve the Age of Autonomy newsletter and CEPA's latest work on Defense Tech. \n\u201cThe problem is that if Russians capture one or two positions, then you immediately start to have gaps in your front,\u201d said Muzyka. \u201cUkraine doesn\u2019t have the manpower to quickly respond to such events. Drones are used to plug the gaps and then deploy any available reserves to the frontline, but as we\u2019ve seen recently, it doesn\u2019t always work.\u201d\nRussian forces are also adapting. To blind Ukrainian artillery, Moscow has stepped up strikes on the radar stations guiding drone interceptors, . The attacks limit Ukraine\u2019s ability to knock down reconnaissance drones that guide Russian glide bombs and ballistic missiles aimed at its rear.",
            "Its increased drone production is extraordinary. It went from producing 1.5 to 2 million drones, to a projected . The country has also made impressive advances across drone software, hardware adaptation, and domestic production, now producing [30% of its own weapons domestically](https://www.csis.org/analysis/can-ukraine-fight-without-us-aid-seven-questions-ask).\n\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable,\u201d said Boul\u00e8gue, \u201cWhen you have not much left and you still make it work because you\u2019re innovative, you\u2019re quick, you\u2019re smart, and you don\u2019t have a choice because if you stop, then your country disappears.\u201d\nThe coming months will be challenging, not least because of concerns that joint Chinese-Russian engineering teams are now producing standardized products at a huge scale \u2014 Ukrainian experts Russia could send 1,000 Shaded-type drones against its defenses every night.\nFrom Ukraine\u2019s perspective, it needs every element of its defense system to work well. There will be \u201ca premium on the efficiency of Ukrainian drone and artillery operations, the ability of Ukrainian commanders to preserve their troops, and the continuity of supplies flowing from Ukraine\u2019s international partners,\u201d said Watling.\nHe, for one, is optimistic. If Ukraine can stop Russia \u201creaching the borders of Donetsk between now and Christmas, and Kyiv\u2019s [allies] are diligent in degrading Russia\u2019s economy, Moscow will face hard choices about the costs\u2026 [of] continuing the war,\u201d he said.\n_Mila Tanghe holds a master\u2019s degree from Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism and was an Intern with the Editorial team at the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA)._"
