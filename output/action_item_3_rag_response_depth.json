  "question_context": null,
  "answer": "Recent research from Stanford has identified six biological subtypes (biotypes) of depression, each characterized by different brain activity patterns with relevance to treatment remission rates for major depressive disorder (MDD)[1]. Among these, the cognitive biotype stands out for its involvement in remission outcomes. This particular biotype, comprising about 27% of depressed patients, is distinguished by significant cognitive impairments in executive function and response inhibition, along with notably reduced activation of the cognitive control circuit\u2014specifically decreased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)[2][3].\n\nIn terms of remission rates, patients with the cognitive biotype had lower remission after treatment with common antidepressants compared to those without this biotype. Specifically, overall remission rates were 38.8% for patients with the cognitive biotype versus 47.7% for those without it. This difference was particularly evident in treatment with sertraline, where remission was 35.9% in the cognitive biotype group compared to 50% in others[4][2][3]. These findings emphasize that patients with the cognitive biotype respond less favorably to standard pharmacotherapy, likely due to persistent cognitive deficits post-treatment[3].\n\nOther biotypes also showed differential treatment responses. For example, a subtype characterized by overactivity in cognitive brain regions responded best to venlafaxine (Effexor), while another with higher resting activity in brain regions related to depression and problem solving showed better outcomes with talk therapy. Conversely, a biotype with lower resting activity in attention-controlling circuits was less responsive to talk therapy[1].\n\nStanford researchers are actively exploring targeted treatments for these biotypes. For the cognitive biotype, there is interest in therapies specifically addressing cognitive dysfunction and in testing medications such as guanfacine that target the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex[4][1][2]. Overall, the identification of biotypes, especially the cognitive subtype, contributes to precision psychiatry by informing individualized treatment strategies aimed at improving remission rates in MDD[4][1].\n\nReferences:\n- Cognitive biotype characterized by impaired executive function and reduced cognitive control circuit activity lowers remission rates to ~38.8% versus 47.7% without this biotype[4][2][3].\n- Sertraline shows particularly reduced remission in cognitive biotype (35.9%) compared to others (50%)[4][2][3].\n- Other biotypes respond differently: overactive cognitive regions biotype benefits from venlafaxine; higher resting activity biotype responds better to talk therapy; low resting attention circuit biotype less responsive to talk therapy[1].\n- Targeted treatments, including those addressing cognition directly, are under investigation for cognitive biotype patients[4][1][2].",

        "Stanford Researchers Identify Six Subtypes of Depression Using Imaging Technology and Machine Learning\nWith better methods needed for matching patients with with appropriate treatments, researchers at Stanford University, , say they have identified six biological subtypes (biotypes) of depression. The team also identified existing treatments that could be more likely, or less likely, to be effective against three of those biotypes.\nAccording to statistics from the National Institute of Mental Health\u2019s [2021 National Survey on Drug Use and Health](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/release/2021-national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-releases), roughly 21 million people (8.3% of the population) in the United States suffer from major depression. The rates are significantly higher for women (10.3%) than for males (6.2%). Major depression is defined as a period of at least two weeks when a person experienced a depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, and had a majority of specified symptoms, such as problems with sleep, eating, energy, concentration, or self-worth.\nAmong people with depression, around 30% of them have treatment-resistant depression, meaning multiple kinds of medication or therapy fail to improve their symptoms. Further, as many as two-thirds of people with depression fail to fully reverse their symptoms through treatment. One reason is a lack of data showing which treatments could help which patients, with current practice relying on trial and error to find a treatment that works. In some cases, depression can worsen during the period of trying to find the correct treatment.",
        "\u201cThe goal of our work is figuring out how we can get it right the first time,\u201d said senior author Leanne Williams, PhD, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and the director of Stanford Medicine\u2019s Center for Precision Mental Health and Wellness. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating to be in the field of depression and not have a better alternative to this one-size-fits-all approach.\u201d\nTo gain a better understanding of the different biotypes of the disease, Williams and colleagues enrolled 801 people in their study, all of whom were previously diagnosed with depression or anxiety using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to measure their brain activity. Brains scans were conducted both while the participants were at rest, doing, and while doing different tasks that test their cognitive and emotional functioning. The imaging was focused on areas of the brain that are already known to play a role in depression.\nWith these data, the investigators then applied the machine learning approach called cluster analysis to group the brain images of the patients and identified six distinctive patterns of brain activity in the regions studied.\nThe team also randomly assigned 250 patients to receive one of three commonly prescribed treatments for depression, either medication or behavior talk therapy. One subtype, characterized by overactivity in cognitive regions of the brain showed best results in participants when treated with venlafaxine (brand name Effexor) compared with those who have other biotypes.\nA second subtype whose signature showed higher levels of activity in three regions of the brain associated with depression and problem solving in patients at rest showed better treatment outcomes when they participated in talk therapy. People with the third subtype, who had lower levels of activity at rest in the brain circuit that controls attention, were less likely to see improvement of their symptoms with talk therapy than those with other biotypes."

        "The cognitive biotype positive subgroup was distinguished by significantly lower rates of response and remission to antidepressants (HRSD-17 response, 103 of 188 [54.8%] vs 340 of 524 [64.9%]; = .02; HRSD-17 remission, 73 of 188 [38.8%] vs 250 of 524 [47.7%]; = .04). This biotype also had significantly lower response and remission rates for sertraline in particular (HRSD-17 response, 31 of 64 [48.4%] vs 132 of 182 [72.5%]; < .001; HRSD-17 remission, 23 of 64 [35.9%] vs 91 of 182 [50.0%]; = .04). Subgroups did not differ in profiles of individual symptom improvement within response and remission categories. Regarding functional impairment posttreatment, there was no interaction of the cognitive biotype with pretreatment vs posttreatment change in psychosocial function as measured by SOFAS. For cognitive impairment posttreatment, there was a significant interaction of cognitive subtype with pretreatment vs posttreatment change (or lack of change) in cognitive performance (executive function: = 0.241; .001; response inhibition: = 0.750; < .001). Cognitive impairments persisted posttreatment in the cognitive biotype positive subgroup, remaining at least 0.2 standard deviations below the healthy mean, whereas performance improved during the treatment period for the biotype negative subgroup, especially for cognitive control domains of executive function and response inhibition (eFigure 3 in ).\n### Cognitive Impairment and Overall Symptom Response Following 8 Weeks of Treatment",
        "A total of 1008 patients (571 [56.6%] female; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [12.6] years) participated in the overall trial and 96 patients participated in the imaging substudy (45 [46.7%] female; mean [SD] age, 34.5 [13.5] years). Cluster analysis identified what may be referred to as a cognitive biotype of 27% of depressed patients with prominent behavioral impairment in executive function and response inhibition domains of cognitive control. This biotype was characterized by a specific profile of pretreatment depressive symptoms, worse psychosocial functioning ( = \u22120.25; 95% CI, \u22120.39 to \u22120.11; < .001), and reduced activation of the cognitive control circuit (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex: = \u22120.78; 95% CI, \u22121.28 to \u22120.27; = 003). Remission was comparatively lower in the cognitive biotype positive subgroup (73 of 188 [38.8%] vs 250 of 524 [47.7%]; = .04) and cognitive impairments persisted regardless of symptom change (executive function: = 0.241; .001; response inhibition: = 0.750; < .001). The extent of symptom and functional change was specifically mediated by change in cognition but not the reverse.\nOur findings suggest the presence of a cognitive biotype of depression with distinct neural correlates, and a functional clinical profile that responds poorly to standard antidepressants and instead may benefit from therapies specifically targeting cognitive dysfunction.",
        "\u03c7 tests were used to compare clusters on binary response and remission with antidepressant treatment and type of treatment at 8 weeks. Clusters were compared on change in function and cognitive measures using mixed model analysis of variance.\n#### Treatment Outcomes as a Function of Cognitive Impairment\nTo further assess clinical meaningfulness of the cognitive biotype, we undertook mediation analyses to test whether symptom and functional improvement following 8 weeks of treatment rely on improvement in cognition at 8 weeks. Mediation models were implemented using the Preacher-Hayes bootstrapping method for estimating a simple mediation model with a binary predictor , a continuous mediator , and outcome variable . PROCESS Macro was used to implement the Preacher-Hayes method in SPSS (with being cognitive biotype; , change in executive function or response inhibition; , change in HRSD-17 symptom rating or SOFAS; confidence interval based on 5000 bootstrapped samples) (eMethods in ). We note that, while temporal precedence is ideal in mediation models, the method we used does not require this to be the case. Age, baseline HRSD-17, and family history of MDD were used as covariates in the mediation models.\nThe 1008 MDD patients were 18 to 65 years old (mean [SD] age, 37.8 [12.6] years) and 57% female (167 [17%] Black, 83 [8%] Hispanic, 625 [62%] White). The 96 patients who participated in the imaging substudy were 47% female and had a mean age of 34.5 (13.5) years (eTable 1 in )."

        "The different biotypes also correlate with differences in symptoms and task performance among the trial participants. Those with overactive cognitive regions of the brain, for example, had higher levels of anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure) than those with other biotypes; they also performed worse on executive function tasks. Those with the subtype that responded best to talk therapy also made errors on executive function tasks but performed well on cognitive tasks.\nOne of the six biotypes uncovered in the study showed no noticeable brain activity differences in the imaged regions from the activity of people without depression. Williams believes they likely haven't explored the full range of brain biology underlying this disorder - their study focused on regions known to be involved in depression and anxiety, but there could be other types of dysfunction in this biotype that their imaging didn't capture.\nWilliams and her team are expanding the imaging study to include more participants. She also wants to test more kinds of treatments in all six biotypes, including medicines that haven't traditionally been used for depression.\nHer colleague , MD, PhD, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, has begun using the imaging technique in her clinical practice at Stanford Medicine through . The team also wants to establish easy-to-follow standards for the method so that other practicing psychiatrists can begin implementing it.\n\"To really move the field toward precision psychiatry, we need to identify treatments most likely to be effective for patients and get them on that treatment as soon as possible,\" Ma said. \"Having information on their brain function, in particular the validated signatures we evaluated in this study, would help inform more precise treatment and prescriptions for individuals.\""

        "\"This study is crucial because psychiatrists have few measurement tools for depression to help make treatment decisions,\" said , MD, PhD, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. \"It's mostly making observations and self-report measures. Imaging while performing cognitive tasks is rather novel in depression treatment studies.\"\nPre-treatment fMRI showed those with the cognitive biotype had significantly reduced activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and dorsal anterior cingulate regions during the GoNoGo task compared with the activity levels in participants who did not have the cognitive biotype. Together, the two regions form the cognitive control circuit, which is responsible for limiting unwanted or irrelevant thoughts and responses and improving goal selection, among other tasks.\nAfter treatment, the researchers found that for the three antidepressants administered, the overall remission rates - the absence of overall depression symptoms - were 38.8% for participants with the newly discovered biotype and 47.7% for those without it. This difference was most prominent for sertraline, for which the remission rates were 35.9% and 50% for those with the biotype and those without, respectively.\n\"Depression presents in different ways in different people, but finding commonalities - like similar profiles of brain function - helps medical professionals effectively treat participants by individualizing care,\" Williams said.\n### Depression isn't one size fits all\nWilliams and Hack propose that behavior measurement and imaging could help diagnose depression biotypes and lead to better treatment.

        "As many as one-third of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not fully recover after trying multiple antidepressants. The outcomes are grave for these unremitted patients; they often become chronically disabled, experience poor quality of life, and are at heightened risk of suicide. Even for those who do remit, residual symptoms\u2014which commonly include cognitive dysfunction\u2014can be debilitating. In this study, we focus on cognitive impairment in depression, a leading contributor to non-response to antidepressants, poor functional and social outcomes, and increased risk of suicide. Our previous research identified a distinct subgroup, termed \u201ccognitive biotype+\u201d, within the population of adults with depression. This biotype, comprising that 27% of patients, is characterized by pre-treatment global cognitive impairments, particularly in cognitive control domains.\nCompared to other individuals with depression, those in the cognitive biotype + subgroup exhibit significantly reduced task-evoked activation and functional connectivity in key regions within the cognitive control circuit, specifically the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Moreover, they demonstrate a poorer response to standard pharmacotherapy. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that individuals within this cognitive biotype of depression require targeted treatments that address dysfunction within cognitive control circuitry."
